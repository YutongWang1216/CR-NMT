26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate its enriched uranium production, further violating the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported Monday.
The IAEA report notes that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium," according to the IAEA's synthesis.
Iran is gradually violating the limits of the nuclear deal reached with the big powers in 2015 since President Trump pulled out of the deal last May and imposed sanctions on the country.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can refine uranium only with the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
On the afternoon of May 25, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Muto held talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in New York, confirming that the two sides would press ahead with negotiations on a peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the four northern islands (Russian-Japanese disputed islands, known as the "Northern Four Islands" or the "South Kuril Islands") and develop bilateral ties in a wide range of political and economic fields.
It was Mao Mu's first consultations with Russia as head of peace treaty-building negotiations since taking office as foreign minister.
"Involving the promotion of joint economic activities [on the four northern islands]," Mao told Russia, "it is hoped that consultations will actually be launched".
The talks did not discuss territorial issues in detail, the Japanese government said.
At the Japan-Russia summit in December 2018, the two foreign ministers confirmed the direction of accelerating negotiations as heads of the two countries.
At the talks, the two foreign ministers welcomed the progress of consultations on common economic activities in the areas of tourism and garbage disposal.
"Hopefully, the successful implementation will lead to the next step, " he said in anticipation of the pilot operation scheduled for October.
In addition, the talks confirmed that Lavrov's visit to Japan in November will coincide with the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Nagoya.

Women's volleyball is expected to defend its World Cup title early!
27 against the Dutch women's volleyball team, China won two sets in a row by their opponents back to a city, finally to the Netherlands 3-1, welcomed a nine-game winning streak.
The World Cup is drawing to a close, and while the defending championship is in sight, China's women's volleyball team will not be taken lightly against Serbia.
The first two sets of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team's performance as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 respectively first down two cities, until the third set, the team encountered setbacks.
The Dutch women's volleyball team in the back of the situation to strengthen the attacking serve, the Chinese team was attacked by a pass, plus the girls attacking, errors began to increase, eventually by 21:25 by the opponents back to a city.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the game: "The third inning, because of mistakes we sent about 8 points. "
Of course, the Dutch women's volleyball strength is not to be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball also prepared for difficulties, although lost a set, but everything is still in Lang Ping's grasp, "with the strong team to win and lose the game is normal, play five sets is normal, so we say to the players to focus," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted to the situation, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the fire, a single score of 8 points, for the team to win a major contribution.
So far, only two of the 11 matches have been played, and China's women's volleyball team, with one hand on the trophy, did sound the alarm against the Dutch: the more critical it is, the more it has to do.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and the United States played five sets and the U.S. failed to take all three points from their opponents.
All sorts of things are developing in favour of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, Serbia's absence of all six of their main players does not mean they will give the three points easily to China.
From the current table, the Serbian team has been largely without a medal, which means they can "lighten up" against the Chinese women's volleyball team, laying down the baggage to fully impact the opponents, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the championship, the state may have ups and downs.
In addition, the substitute Serbia is not "anybody slaughtered" the lamb, after the Netherlands and the two sides in a five-game battle, the Serbian second team finally 3:2 reversed the Netherlands' main line-up, thus the thickness of its line-up.
Before the start of the third period, Lang Ping also said that neither team is good: "Osaka is going to be a very difficult game, we still have to prepare as usual, serious.
Now that the trumpet has been blown, the game has really entered the "white-hot stage".
On the strength of the line-up, the Chinese women's volleyball team are above their opponents, only the last critical juncture, but also to see if the women's volleyball girls can play at a normal level, in the field to free themselves.

In a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Stoltenberg said: "For 70 years, NATO's containment and defense measures have been based on maintaining technological superiority."
But times are changing,' he said.
Mr Stoltenberg said: "The competition we are experiencing is getting tougher and tougher.
We should therefore now redouble our efforts in order to be sure that no one will surpass us.
He said: "Some new technologies are not being developed by Nato members, but in dictatorships.
Chinese companies are working on 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent internet and investing heavily in the next generation of weapons, such as hypersonic missiles.
NATO's future security "depends on the ability to understand, accept and apply the latest advanced technologies," Stoltenberg said.
More than 100 disabled people from Changsha have been invited to board the Orange Island Star Cruise Line to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who took part in the event were aboard the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a crippled man who rarely goes out because of inconvenience from his feet.
He said: "To take a cruise for the first time today, to see the vastness of the Xiangjiang River up close, to feel the pulse of Changsha's development, I am very excited and unforgettable.
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha provided meticulous services to the disabled.
Specially for people with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carry them up and down the cruise ship.
Over the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has developed steadily, and more and more disabled people have become participants, contributors and enjoyers of social and economic development.
... span class='class1'>The republic is celebrating its seventieth anniversary, and the media spotlights are bursting on the republic, shining with images we don't normally remember - the ones who brought heat and light to our shining days
However, if the hero walks alongside, also seems to be ordinary as you as me.
Yuan Longping, a devoted paddy researcher, has cultivated good seeds all over the world, so that more than a billion people will not have the risk of famine, and his achievements have been great. He is like an old peasant who likes to wander around the fields. Nan Rendong, a leading scientist who has been working hard to make China's sky-eyed people angry, spends six or seven hours a day on the plateau in order to rehearse his plays. Zhou Ruchang, a red scholar, likes to shout and laugh when he is old.
They are simple, simple and persistent in their lives. They are easy to be cheerful if they immerse themselves in a cause that others do not understand and which they hold dear to themselves.
Like in Jin Yong's novels, the sweeping monk of the Tibetan scripture hall in Shaolin Temple, though embracing martial arts, is not showy, joyless and sad.
Every "sweeping monk" , every pair of naked hearts, behind the back has a homeland to give me who to bear.
Homeland shoulder, not only in the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of millions of people.
Once, a female high school student said, by Internet users crazy turn, "When the hero passes by, there will always be someone sitting on the roadside to applaud ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be the person sitting on the roadside to applaud.
Actually, when the hero and give the hero applause, is not contradictory.
The roadside clappers are also passing on heat and light, themselves luminous bodies.
Ordinary as you are like me, there are always some opportunities in life, some moments, there is a cumulative accumulation of heroic appearance.
Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai, shouldered the burden of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting of the old master of the communications room on stage to tell his story, a year received and sent numerous newspaper letters, from no mistake, " simple things done, is not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges to applause to the "sweeping monk"-style old receivers.
It's a little bit of pity between heroes, one hero applauding the other.
Sweeping monks have the Tibetan scripture hall of Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping has the vast experimental rice field, Nan Rendong has the "eye of the sky", Qin Yi has the stage and Zhou Ruchang has the pulpit Whether a hero can be made depends not only on his own efforts, but also on a good environment and positive motivational mechanism.
For example, the "Chinese Sky-Eye", as it stands today, is a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community is still climbing hard, the novelist Liu Tsi-shing has not yet written "Three Body" .
The bull's eye at that time was the single-sided calibre radio telescope Arecibo, a 350-meter diameter telescope in the valleys of the United States island of Puerto Rico, considered the most insurmountable in the world.
At that time, Chinese radio telescopes were less than one tenth the diameter of others.
But Nan, who enjoys world - class research and salary, insists on returning home with a near - mad idea of building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space.
China's hundred waste to rejuvenate ah, investing huge sums of money to play stars?
With the trust of the motherland, the "sky-eyed" project opened with great splendor.
It took 12 years for the site to be chosen and another nine years for the project to be completed.
With the opening of the 500-meter diameter "eye of the sky", China has achieved a "world-class scientific project" without precedent.
Therefore, the "eye of the sky" is great, Nanrendong are great, there is a big, standing tall and distant republic is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have a chance to become the soul of the country and the liver of the people.
There are young talented, gray-haired heroes gracefully passed, there are people in the roadside gently applauded, such a beautiful and harmonious country.
Garbage Sorting Education Leads Jilin Nursery School
27 (Xinhua) -- A kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin Province, began classifying garbage and taught children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is understood this is the first time rubbish classification has been introduced into local early childhood education classrooms.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Jilin Province to promote the classification and disposal of municipal waste" .
On the basis of a pilot of compulsory household waste classification in Changchun in 2019, the province decided to carry out the work of household waste classification in the ground-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, we can realize the effect that children lead families and kindergartens lead society, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Held the event Hey Fan International kindergarten executive director Liu Lijuan said.
On the same day, the director of the garden read out the environmental initiative, the hope that the garbage classification from the children.
After performing the "Low Carbon Bei Bei" dance, the children teamed up to do a garbage sorting game.
Instructors also issued "recyclable" "other rubbish" labels, advising children to glue labels to bins and record small videos when they get home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has been advocating low-carbon, green environmental protection concepts, regular environmental lectures.
A sortable garbage can is also set up at the garbage disposal area of the garden, with the categories of disposal marked on it.
The teacher taught the children what recyclable garbage was.
According to preliminary statistics, Jilin province will generate about 54.652 million tons of municipal waste in 2018, all of which will go into municipal waste disposal sites for disposal.
Among them, 329.29 million tons were buried in sanitary landfills, 29.93 million tons were incinerated and 801,000 tons were disposed of by an integrated utilization process.
After many years of efforts, all the municipalities and counties in this province have the capacity of harmless disposal of domestic waste.
The "Proposal for Promoting Garbage Sorting and Disposal in Jilin City at the Local Level" issued by Jilin Province explicitly calls for in-depth activities such as garbage sorting into schools, teaching materials and classrooms.Through the creation of garbage sorting songs, ballads, cartoons and micro-videos, the interaction between students and parents can be enhanced, so as to "educate a child, influence a family, promote a community and foster a new generation" .

Chirac dies, political legacy endures
26 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Jacques Chirac has died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing an unprecedented upheaval, the French politician's political legacy still deserves our praise.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a highly charismatic manner.
He inherited Charles de Gaulle's independent spirit of diplomacy and strong support for European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European dream" .
At the same time, he also advocates world multi-polarization and multilateralism, is a strategic-minded politician.
For this reason, the French media described him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Mr Chirac's most enjoyable political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to resist American pressure, leading the anti-war front.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to heightened terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
It later turned out that Chirac was quite right in his warning.
At a time when European integration is faltering and U.S. unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the "golden decade" of Sino-French relations, and after being first elected president of France in 1995, he pushed for the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a statesman's strategic vision.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between the two countries entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthroughs in cooperation in a variety of fields, including aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation.
The Sino-French Cultural Year, initiated by Chirac, has created a brand-new mode of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's love of Chinese culture throughout his life has been particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats introduced, Chirac can recite some poems of Li Bai, Du Fu, and even accurately judge the age of the Chinese bronze history.
"It is not true that the pyramids have not been to Egypt, it is not true that the Terracotta Warriors have not been to China" - this golden phrase comes from Chirac.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political status internationally.
But I have confidence in China myself.
I believe that China, a country with a long history of civilization, has sufficient experience to help it build its concepts and values of harmonious development and shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich it.
The Sri Lankans have gone, but Chirac's political legacy and revelations for the world will live on.

HKSAR Legislative Council Members Against U.S.-linked Hong Kong Bill
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Legislative Council issued a joint statement on Tuesday, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019" by the U.S. House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees.
The statement, by a coalition of 40 constitutional lawmakers, said Hong Kong's current rights under the Basic Law include maintaining its status as a free-trade port and a separate customs territory, conducting business, cooperation and development with different countries and regions around the world in the name of "Hong Kong, China" and signing and enforcing bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, including economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always adhered strictly to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics. It has engaged in a wide range of cooperation with different countries and regions and achieved remarkable results.
The statement said the U.S. House and Senate foreign affairs committees' move to pass the bill was unnecessary and was in response to calls from their Hong Kong surrogates to intervene roughly in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seek political leverage for their surrogates in Hong Kong.
Establishment lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and source of the largest trade surplus for the United States.
Hong Kong's good rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
Such a bill, in addition to striking Hong Kong and the interests of the United States itself, would exacerbate Sino-U.S. relations without any benefit at the expense of others.
The statement said Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" principle, continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and earnestly fulfil its obligations.
Whether past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international business.
The two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week, the European Times reported on Tuesday.
In recent days, the French President, Jean-Marc Ayrault, claimed that France was unable to "take in all" but was trying to do so "properly".
Reports suggest that Mr Macrone is trying to find a middle ground on immigration, slowing the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly's general debate in New York, Mr. MacLean expressed hope for a genuine "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy, finding a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to be able to accommodate [migrants] properly, it can't accommodate everyone."
Mr. Macrone listed four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum eligibility to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficiently promoting integration of migrants; hosting and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficiently resettling people who entered France illegally and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "state medical aid" (AME) system has been the most talked-about topic in the past.
Mr Macrone said he hoped to be able to "assess" the system, but not remove it, instead putting some limits on it.
Following Duterte's comments, far-right "National League" leader Marine Le Pen tweeted that Duterte's statement was "empty talk."
Senate Speaker Mitch Lasschel, a member of the right-wing Republican wing, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "confrontational" way, indirectly criticizing Mr. Macrone.
Leftist Socialist MP François Varouw argued that France should "take in more and better" on immigration and criticised Mr Macron for "rigging" the subject.
The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in force for a year, has led to a split in opinion within the ruling party while failing to placate opposition parties on the right, the report noted.
Immigration policy topics will once again be the focus of attacks from the far right in the next 2022 election, an issue on which Mr. Macrone needs to make a difference, but also at the risk of angering left-wingers within the ruling party.
France's lower house of the National Assembly will reportedly debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are in the midst of a buyback boom, with many listed companies offering genuine gold and silver to buy back shares.
According to financial data servicer Oriental Wealth, the total amount of A-share repurchase funds of listed companies in the year to 27 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same as below), far surpassing the previous figures and setting an all-time high for A-share repurchase funds.
In response, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mykerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said the lower overall valuation of the A-share market this year and the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices are conducive to improving the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, as well as reflecting the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for listed companies to repurchase shares, providing detailed rules and guidelines for listed companies to repurchase shares.
So far this year, according to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the buyback plan are mainly concentrated in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing industries.
Additionally, six listed companies have more than $1 billion in buyback payments this year, judging by the amount paid back.
Topping the list is Erie shares, with more than $5 billion in buybacks.
What impact will listed companies'repurchase of shares have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Finance at Renmin University of China, told Xinhua news agency that on the one hand, the buybacks show that listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial condition, and are capable of maintaining stock price stability and giving investors confidence; on the other hand, they also show that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are accountable to the company, to the market and to investors for their accountability considerations.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For capital markets, these are the most core basic elements.
Buying back shares of listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock price of listed companies.
In addition, according to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the total number of A-share listed companies set at the beginning of this year, and the transaction average price of the repurchased shares, this year's repurchased shares for the A-share market is expected to bring more than 150 billion yuan of incremental funds.
It took nearly two months for the restoration of the large mural of the Temple of Heaven in Tianjin, a key cultural and cultural protection unit of the state, to be reopened to the public during this year's National Day.
A large traditional mural that fully reflects the life of Mazu.
Approved by the state authorities, it was painted from 1991 to 1994 by Cai Changkui, director of the former Tianjin Folklore Museum (Tian Hou Palace).
It is understood that the mural was painted on the southern and northern walls of the main hall of the imperial palace. It is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high and is divided into two parts.
In recent years, Tianjin has had rainy summers and dry winters, which caused the murals to crack, accounting for 60 percent of the area, Cai said.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mazu's events, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee of Nankai District of Tianjin City and the Tian Hou Palace launched the restoration project of the Tian Hou Palace and the murals inside the palace.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and four famous Chinese artists were invited to participate.
The restoration works in accordance with the principle of 'old as old', but also the original murals have made local adjustments, the original murals were not perfect repair.
In the restoration, we also in the color, materials, ink and other innovations and attempts.
The restoration has preserved the original fresco's features, spirituality, spirit and artistic style.
Built in 1326, the original Tianfei Palace, commonly known as the Mistress' Palace, has undergone many renovations. It is the oldest building complex in Tianjin City and one of the earliest Mazu Temples in China.
On September 25th, Beijing Daxing International Airport launched a ceremonial ceremony.
The shape of Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal means "Phoenix Showing Wings", which is known as the first of the "seven wonders of the new world".
Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, carrying 100 million+ passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta.
By 2022, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers and account for 20 percent of international flights; by 2025, it will handle 72 million passengers and account for 30 percent of international flights.
As the new gateway, how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province, a direct distance of 46 kilometers from Tian'anmen, the world's largest newly built airport.
Its terminal has a steel-roofed roof with a projected surface area of 180,000 square metres and is the size of 25 standard football pitches.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival floors and two departure floors -- F1-F4 for international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-storey bridge connecting the high-speed and the airport outside the terminal corresponds to the F3 and F4 international departures respectively, both of which are available for domestic departures.
Beijing Daxing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's "double airport" .
So far, 66 airlines have expressed interest in joining Daxing International Airport in Beijing, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan airlines and foreign airlines.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic and 15 international; covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This and Beijing Capital International Airport formed a coordinated development, moderate competition, with the international first-class competitiveness of the "double hub" airport pattern, not only easing the operating pressure of the capital airport capacity saturation, but also better meeting the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and the surrounding areas, effectively enhancing the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
To ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport takes full account of its geographical location, airport's relationship with its surrounding airspace and operating environment.For the first time in China, the airport's runway has adopted a "all-directional" layout, adopted the world's largest air control automation system, and set up China's largest terminal control area to maximize air operation efficiency.
For the first time, domestic airports have adopted the domestic automatic baggage handling and information management system, and adopted the innovative baggage transfer mode to improve the efficiency of the baggage handling system.
Beijing Daxing International Airport's first flight, the Phoenix shows off its cool wings to take off.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts and a domesticization rate of more than 98 percent, is bound to have direct and indirect economic impact on industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
Ma Hua tentatively to hold November congress, proposes to lower party age to 16
Ma tentatively scheduled a central congress in early November to amend the party charter to lower the party's age to 16.
With Congress passing a downward revision of the voting age for general elections, Ma Hua announced that the 66th Central Congress, which will convene this year, will present proposals for changes to the party constitution, including lowering Ma Hua's entry age to 16 from the current 18.
The meeting was scheduled for November 2 and 3 of this year, but due to a by-election for the seat of Thandoo Biai, the date could change, said Governor of the Ma Hua Association, Nathan Srivaddhanaprabha.
Since the Electoral Commission will not meet until October 1 to finalize the day of nominations and voting for the by-election for Mr. Danube's seat, they will meet the following day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's central congress, he said.
He also explained that the purpose of holding the CPC Central Committee yesterday (26th) to finalise the date of the congress and to amend the party constitution had only happened to coincide with the tragic death of the parliamentary member of the Indigenous Unity Party, Thandoo Biaeli, and had therefore been added to the agenda of the by-election.
Wang Boxiang, secretary of Shouguang county committee in Shandong Province - Qiang County rich people Chizi heart - Xinhua News Agency
Wang Boxiang, a native of Shouguang, Shandong Province, was born in February 1943. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in 1967 and held positions as Party secretary, secretary of county committee and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was secretary of the Shouguang county committee in Shandong Province, then the poor county of Weifang.
In his five years in office, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: first, promoting the industrialization of vegetables; secondly, developing Shoubei salt flats; and thirdly, laying the foundation for the industrial turnaround, so that Shouguang people have since bulged their pockets and raised their waistlines.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables as well as lessons from growing them.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers planted a bumper harvest but could not sell it, rotting in the ground.
Wang found that the key to grasping vegetables is good circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building the wholesale vegetable market and opened the prelude to the development of the market economy.
Party cadres should take the lead, and if they fail, all the losses will be borne by the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, set up 17 winter-heated vegetable sheds.
Subsequently, a popularization group was set up in the county.Under Wang's mobilization, Wang Leyi toured the townships and villages to guide them.In the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were popularized.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 1.6 million acres of land in addition to the salt-and-alkali beaches, is a shallow beach.
The local people have a very hard life.
Shou Nan has vegetable shed, Shou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized more than 100,000 people to engage in a general war, camped on the desolate alkali beach, forty or fifty days.
At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields and 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and coated the salt-and-alkali beaches with "pool basin".
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended the Weifang City Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county committee.
During the meeting, a "Comparison Table of Industrial Economy Figures in Twelve Counties of Weifang City" was issued.At first glance, the industrial output value was not bad, and it ranked fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value is only 1.19 billion yuan, which ranks in the bottom three.
With a delegation of more than 70 people, Wang Boxiang ran to the field to "change his mind".
Within a year of returning, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, "spiritual tours" have been organized every year to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang lacks enterprises, even less entrepreneurs.
Mr. Wang chaired a conference panel to select managers of factories openly in the county, 40 "career-minded able people" to stand out and be promoted to the front line of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the nation's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang City deputy mayor.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4,84 enterprises, more than 100,000 "ten thousand yuan" households and cadres recognized by the people.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presides over a meeting of foreign ministers of China and African members of the Security Council at the United Nations headquarters in New York on September 26, local time.
The meeting was attended by Africa's current Security Council member Foreign Minister Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea's Foreign Minister Guy O'Jono, South Africa's Foreign Minister Pandol and the incoming member Foreign Ministers of Niger and Tunisia's Foreign Minister Mohamed Jahinawi, among others.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, strength comes from unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations is undermined, to the detriment of the interests of the vast number of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, and unity to strengthen.
In the Security Council, where the three African countries speak with one voice, the weight of focus is not just on the three votes, but on the continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa will not just have four votes, but will lead other countries to follow up, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, and we must make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, settle disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hot-button issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex conundrums on the Council's agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly rooted in the scourge of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and play the role of the UN in good offices and mediation.
Third, self-improvement.
African countries and people know Africa's problems best. Africa also has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In dealing with Africa's hot-button issues, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's wishes, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China stands ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and resolutely promote capacity-building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We must put economic and social development first and support each other in the development path they have chosen.
China is willing to work closely with the AU's Agenda 2063, the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
China has provided and will continue to provide all the human and material assistance to the Congolese Ebola outbreak, and is ready to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize more assistance from the United Nations and WHO, so as to play the role of the UN Stabilization Mission in Congo (King).

"At the time, the woman was lying half in the driver's seat with amniotic fluid and blood and a baby boy next to her with an umbilical cord. "
Zhang Huan asked to know that the baby is 32 weeks premature, parents on the way to cover the child did not have time to wrap, the early autumn morning has been cool, he froze pale skin, no crying, limbs paralyzed.
Liu Yanyan hurried to the co-driver to handle the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Huan drilled in from the cab, quickly opened the birth bag, with the inside of the treatment towel and the birth bag wrapped several layers of warmth, and cleaned the neonatal airway (pictured), then cradled the baby up to the 12th floor neonatal department.
When the neonatal nurse got the news, she rushed to the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby.
The doctor immediately gave him a trachea intubation. Less than a minute later, the baby's heartbeat returned and his skin color gradually returned to rosy.
After being admitted to hospital, the 32-week-old was put on a traumatic ventilator. After sustained rescue, the baby's breathing was steady and the next day it was successfully evacuated.

In case of pelvic floor in the home or on the road, expectant mothers should try to lie flat, can put a blanket under their hips and so on, to prevent the baby to give birth after head-butt, the child should be immediately warm, as soon as possible to the nearest doctor.

Wuhan Promotes Intellectualized Transformation of Industrial Enterprises by Giving Up to 20 Million yuan in Subsidy
Since the beginning of this year, Wuhan has accelerated the industrial intelligent transformation and implemented the transformation subsidy measures of up to 20 million yuan, the reporter learned from the press office of Wuhan Municipal Government.
Up to now, we have collected more than 800 industrial enterprises over the scale of intellectualized transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director-general of Wuhan's Bureau of Economic and Information Technology, said that from this year onwards, Wuhan will launch an action plan for intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises, provide free consulting and diagnostic services and propose solutions for industrial enterprises of demanding sizes and above, and push forward a new round of technological transformation of high-level enterprises in an all-round way.
According to the plan, Wuhan will openly select a number of specialized diagnostic services organizations each year and conduct a census of the needs of all industrial enterprises at or above the city's scale for intellectual transformation through the opening of columns, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door reporting.
So far, more than 800 industrial enterprises have been collected, accounting for nearly one-third of the industrial enterprises above the size of the city.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter the enterprises in batches, carrying out "one-on-one" on-site evaluation and program demonstration.

Trudeau's man - made collapse, can he still succeed in re-election?
This time, Trudeau stumbled out of a "big hole" that he had dug a little by himself.
In recent days, Canadian media have revealed a spate of old photographs of Trudeau, the current prime minister, posing as a black man.
It was deemed an apparent act of racial discrimination and prompted an uproar in Canada.
Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public after it happened.
Canadians, however, aren't buying much.
Trudeau managed to lift the stone and smash himself in the foot.
As political commentators Riley et al. have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing dissidents in the opposition or within their own party of having a "massive deficit" in this regard, repeatedly threatening that "whoever makes this mistake should be fired immediately."
Simply put, this time it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" that had tripped him up.
The son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau was a handsome young man who had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first came out.
Originally a "political vegetarian," he took over as head of the federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in Canada's 2015 federal legislative elections - with the federal Liberals holding more than half of the seats in the federal lower house and securing valuable separate grouping cabinet powers.
At that time, Mr. Trudeau had put forward many promising platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "improper practices".
However, for five years in office, he has "walked high and low" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
Ethnic and gender equality issues aside, the Blackface incident follows a series of rhetorical misogyny about indigenous issues that saw Aboriginal groups and leaders move protest tents to the gates of Parliament House on Canada's 150th anniversary.
Late last year and early this year, Mr Trudeau became embroiled in a roiling "Lan Wan Ling" .
It was revealed that his hometown's construction and engineering company "Lan Wan Ling" major violations of favoritism fraud, to investigate the authorities and officials pressured the latter "high-handed. "
Moreover, Mr. Trudeau became angry with the officials who revealed the abuses - Chaudy Wang, mentioned earlier, was the first Canadian attorney-general to do so and handled the cases directly.
Though the case itself remains suspicious, its suspicions are difficult to wash away.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau's five-year rule was largely the result of his own gouging, and that the biggest holes were those of a tiger's head and a snake's tail, self-eating and self-discipline.
Since 2015, respondents to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll have slipped from more than 60 per cent in favor of Trudeau to more than 30 per cent, while opponents have surged from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Even a significant number of voters who would still vote for the federal Liberals are now dismissive of the federal prime minister, the head of the ruling party, despite similarly poor performances from other opposition parties and their leaders.
As the new Canadian federal legislative elections begin on October 21, can Trudeau still repeat the repertoire of big wins from five years ago?
The answer may be one word: hard.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opens for flights on September 25.
The opening of Daxing International Airport will boost the capacity of the capital's aviation services, the Beijing Development and Reform Commission has been told.
Following on from Shanghai, Beijing will become the second city in China to have two airports in the same city.It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international aviation.
Daxing airport traffic, from the perspective of business development, for the capital airport is more of a positive impact.
Capital Airport's passenger throughput topped 100 million in 2018, the highest in the country, but there is still a significant capacity shortfall compared to fast-growing business demand, particularly with a large gap in demand on international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, such as tourism and business trips, and to meet the development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected cities, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large-scale international hub airport, with plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million and freight and postal throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, also have enough market space.
From the economic point of view, Daxing International Airport's air traffic, will obviously form a win-win effect, ease Beijing's air capacity tension, speed up passenger and cargo throughput growth, build the capital's aviation double-core operation of the incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it will not be necessary to concentrate all travel in the capital airport in the future, but it will also reduce a series of problems caused by the over-concentration of routes, such as the longer transit guarantee time, the slower passenger boarding speed, the indirect increase of aircraft and passenger delay time in the airport, the increased burden of airport operation, and the reduction of load through the capital airport, which will actually improve the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media's calculation of the time and cost of various transportation routes to major international airports, such as from Nanwuhuan to take the highway directly up to Daxing Airport, the highway can be reached in 50 minutes by car, fuel costs about 40 yuan and 15 yuan for the round trip, while choosing the rail transit metro Daxing Airport Line, the distance is limited to 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers according to the distance, fares are divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan.
Overall, the public to Daxing Airport has a variety of transport options, the cost and time are also in a more reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development, Daxing airport is located as a transportation hub between Beijing and Tianjin, so it is a little far away from Beijing, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, making it easier for more people to travel, which is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
Passengers in Hebei and Tianjin could enjoy more international airline services from Daxing International Airport in the future, as seen in Daxing's transportation plans.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, besides Beijing's new airport line directly to Daxing Airport, there are also many highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Guangdong Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the expressways of Guangzhou-Guangdong-Guangdong-Shenzhen, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an New Areas around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport and get convenient and efficient air services.
From this, we can see that Daxing International Airport's air traffic, not only a few additional runways and aircraft, from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only concerns the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation industry to provide a wide range of choices for the residents to travel, promote Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei service quality further enhancement, more conducive to promoting the integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development process and stimulating the economic and trade development around Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for Daxing Airport's aviation, we should calculate not only individual small accounts, but also the overall development of the big accounts.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum to be held in Chengshunhua province
Nguyen Dung, deputy chairman of Vietnam's parliamentary economic committee, revealed that at the beginning of the year, the country's economic and social development showed many new signs of strengthening and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views on the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnam's social and cultural development in 2019, as well as forecasts and proposals for the country's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that in the first few months of 2019, global growth slowed and risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) determined that despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world's economies are in a state of stagnation, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many welcome successes, with a stable macroeconomic performance, effective control of inflation and an average consumer price index (CPI) growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, and while this was lower than the 7.05 per cent growth recorded in the same period last year, it remains at a higher level compared to the same period in the 2011-2016 phase.
Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said the country's economy showed higher growth momentum in 2019 against a backdrop of world economic turmoil, while making a forecast for the country's economic development trends in 2019-2020.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will remain basically stable, the implementation of various self-trade agreements will boost trade development, economic restructuring and the improvement of business environment will be further strengthened, and Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend due to the impact of trade frictions.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese export commodities, seek opportunities to expand new export markets and create facilities for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, we should keep inflation at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the consular office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China with a reception in Siem Reap.
In the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being, Liu said.
As the world's second-largest economy, China contributes more than 30 percent to the world's economic growth, Liu said.In particular, China's "China-Pacific Trade and Economic Cooperation" initiative, and cooperation between local provinces and cities in Siem Reap and the provinces of the territory has been deepening.
He said this year marks the opening of 61 years of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia.The two countries share a brotherly friendship, and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia will be a driving force for the local economic and social development.
The governor of Siem Reap Province, Di Seha, highly praised the great achievements made by the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
D'Sahra expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
Siam Province's friendly exchanges with China's provinces and municipalities have been remarkable, and so far 28 provinces and municipalities have forged friendly city relations with China, with the landing of the big cultural performance projects "Wu Go Smile" and "Wu Go Dynasty," the Siam-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siam New International Airport project, special training courses for Siam provincial government officials, scholarships for Siam students to study in China, rural volunteer clinics, the construction of urban roads, and the public welfare project "Bright Walk" for cataract rehabilitation.
State Secretary of the Cambodian Ministry of Defense Ken Wensong, Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council Weng Heng, Governor of the territory's five provinces, the Siem Reap Sub-Committee of the Cambodian-China Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap Sub-Committee of the Cambodian Chinese Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of foreign consulates in Siem Reap attended the reception.
Witness the Rise of the Cloud in Digital China's Ten Years in a Cloudy Town - Xinhua News Agency
If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou held in the  2019.
From a concept of “in the cloud” to the practice of “up in the cloud”, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies underpinning China’s economic development, social management and public services over the past decade.
At Zhengtai's new energy photovoltaic battery plant in Haining, Zhejiang Province, recent quality inspectors beside a number of new "colleagues" loaded with Aliyun's artificial intelligence.
Its 24-hour non-stop, identification speed is more than twice that of the manual, quality inspection accuracy is stable at 95 percent.
The "quality inspector" with the camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 samples of blemishes, and with the computing power of cloud computing behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language to classify and place faulty batteries, according to the company's head.
The company is a microcosm of today's cloud computing powerhouse manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for Implementation of Enterprises' Going to Cloud ( 2018-2020) " in 2018, which proposed that by 2020, enterprises should strive to achieve a marked increase in awareness and enthusiasm for going to the cloud, and a significant increase in the proportion of enterprises going to the cloud and their depth of application.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way to a digital economy where data is the key ingredient, according to AliCloud founder Wang Jian.
Meanwhile, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has expanded steadily over the past 10 years.
China's cloud computing market as a whole will reach 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 percent from 2017, according to the China Information and Communications Research Institute's Cloud Computing Development White Paper (1959) released in July.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly transformed urban management and social life.
The Urban Brain, which was unveiled for three years in a row at this year's event, remains a cause for concern.
Ali Yun said the city brain has been transformed from a transportation management tool into a hub for city management, and the cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the city brain's powerful computing power, new city management services functions such as "park first, pay later," "real-time perception of attendance," and "design of travel routes" can be implemented.
In the field of government affairs services, cloud computing brings convenience to both sides of the supply of government affairs services by connecting "one thing" with "one cloud" and pushing forward "hands-on office" and "hands-on work".
At present, Zhejiang Province has built a unified public data platform through the cloud of government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million corporate units in the province, putting together 19.08 billion entries in the governance 3066 category.
With an average of 12 million monthly calls and shares between government departments in Zhejiang Province, every more calls on the cloud could mean fewer errands for the masses.
Careful use of plastic tea packets to make tea!
A new Canadian study has found that a packet of plastic tea bags could release billions, if not billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but so far there is no evidence that consumption poses a threat to humans, according to the Central News Agency.
Researchers at Magill University in Canada reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles of plastic into the cup.
That's significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
The average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount, according to the study published earlier in 2019.
In the study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, researchers tested four different types of plastic merchant tea bags at Montelo's stores and cafes, opening them, washing them and dipping them in nearly boiling water for five minutes before analyzing them with an electron microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than previous plastic loads on other foods."
Most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands that use natural fibre to make tea bags still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some branded tea bags have switched from paper to plastic, and these plastic tea bags were the ones the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define as being between 100 nanometers and 5mm in size and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first detected plastic particles in human faeces samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team put water fleas in contaminated water and found that the microplastics affected their behavior and caused them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is so far no evidence that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO noted that more research is needed to fully understand how the plastics spread into the environment and what impacts they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the reason these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles may be that the plastic tea bags come in contact with boiling water and that even when the "eating grade" plastic is heated above 40C, it can break down or leach out toxic substances.
Mr Guterres said climate emergencies were the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
Where a natural disaster can erode the fruits of a generation's development.
Hurricane-hit areas such as Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas this year illustrate this.
About a quarter of people in SIDS live at altitudes of 5 meters or lower.
Relocation can seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
Small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction as they work together to achieve carbon neutral and 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 at the Climate Action Summit on Monday.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones.
While small island developing countries contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also mired in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States," he said.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for seeking assistance to small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-adaptive infrastructure and methods of transition to renewable energy, and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly debt-ridden middle-income countries, obtain financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the lifeline of the planet the oceans.
The latest special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released this week, confirms that the oceans have suffered the "engulfing" harsh consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may be experiencing annual extreme sea level rise that would have occurred only once a century.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken a huge toll.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living coral, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
The demands of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs for transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, leaving them swayed by price fluctuations.
Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illicit trafficking in people weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples for the world to draw on."
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's economy is on track to pick up in the second half of the current fiscal year, helped by demand for holiday spending, as the financial system becomes more liquid, Finance Minister Manmohan Sitaraman said on Tuesday.
Mr. Sitaraman made the remarks after meetings with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and others.
Siatraman did not say where the remarks were aimed.
Some Indian and overseas media have previously blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for the continued slowdown in India's economy.
Citaraman, citing falling auto sales as an example, dismissed liquidity constraints as the main reason for the decline.
Sitaraman noted that the decline in auto sales was largely driven by cyclical factors.
Mr Siatraman expects India's economic growth to recover in the second half of the financial year, driven by festive spending.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to India's economic growth.
The Education Department of Jiangxi Province recently issued a notice forbidding all elementary and middle schools in the province to make up lessons in violation of the National Day holiday and organizing random undercover visits by personnel.
In the "Notice Concerning the Strict Prohibition of Complementary Classes for Violations of the National Day Long Holiday," issued by the Ministry of Education of Jiangxi Province, the ministry stressed that all primary and secondary schools must resolutely do this during the National Day period: No students shall be organized to make up their classes collectively or take new classes, no discipline training courses, special-length classes, Olympian classes, interest classes, enhancing classes, etc., and no campuses or school buildings shall be rented out to other educational institutions to hold various kinds of training courses.
At the same time, it is strictly forbidden for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to organize, recommend and induce students to participate in illegal remedial classes on or off campus, for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to participate in illegal remedial classes on or off campus, or for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to participate in illegal remedial classes organized by other teachers, parents, parent committees, etc., and for in-service primary and secondary school teachers to introduce students and provide relevant information for the out-of-school training institutions and others.
The notice makes it clear that the local administrative department of education will increase the deduction of points in the evaluation of the education of the county-level government for improving the quality of education and that the teachers who participate in the illegal remedial classes will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions on teacher ethics and teacher style.
Supporting pig production and ensuring market supply
Sui loyalty requirements from six aspects to grasp the implementation of various measures
A teleconference on promoting pig production and guaranteeing market supply in the province was held today to mobilize and redeploy the policies and measures of the central and provincial governments on supporting pig production and guaranteeing market supply.
Sui loyalty requirements from six aspects to grasp pig production measures to be implemented.
This year, the task of raising 45 million pigs has been decomposed into municipalities and counties and included in the accountability assessment system.
We will do our best to implement various policies and measures and effectively solve the problem of the "last kilometer" of policy implementation.
We will ensure the production of breedable sows, earnestly implement the policy of subsidizing breedable sows, encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of sows, and select well-bred sows from commercial pig populations in a planned way.
We should take the big domestic breeding enterprises which have not entered our province as the most important ones to attract investment.
We will implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of logistics facilities for pig cold chains, and promote the transition from "pork-mixing" to "meat-mixing" in an all-round way.
In order to ensure the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should provide basic level epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel suited to the breeding scale and tasks, and establish the first line of prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui loyalty requirements, to ensure the full supply of meat market, to ensure that not a large-scale shortage, large-scale supply, to ensure that the major holiday pork market supply smooth.
The meeting also deployed efforts to prevent and control swine plague in Africa, prohibit and retreat fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River Basin, and purchase rice in the middle and late stages of the province.

<unk>淚t is estimated that over-age migrant workers make up more than half of the workforce on some sites.
Where to find young workers now?
Nor would it be desirable to use so many "old men" on the site, there is no way."
Recently, there are many over-age migrant workers on the site (over the retirement age) phenomenon, long years in the construction industry as a project contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities to carry out rain and sewage diversion projects, there are a lot of migrant workers on campus, if you take care to observe, there will be a lot of over-age migrant workers.
The over-age migrant workers are not idle, but because they are unable to be idle. They have to be so helpless and hard - whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or to help their children - that they are driven to continue their hard work.
It is not as easy as we think for over-aged migrant workers to "get on with life".
Raising children, supporting elderly people, providing for children to read, helping children to build buildings and buy cars, helping children to start a family and raising grandchildren, when these migrant workers have completed the "mission of life", the purse has been emptied and even a lot of debts, most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to put off their children and in order to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insisted on "doing until dry. "
The reluctance of many new-generation migrant workers in the "80s, "90s and even "00s to work in hard-pressed, high-intensity secondary industries or in low-end service industries has created a structural "job shortage", which provides opportunities for over-aged migrant workers in unattractive jobs.
Due to the lack of skills, physical functions and labor capacity have declined.Many over-age migrant workers are engaged in jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and low security.
The survival plight of overaged migrant workers behind the "cannot afford to be idle" cannot be ignored and disregarded.
To solve the problem of underpayment and wage-gathering, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income and improve the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers.In addition to their "self-rescue," they also need the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector.
Scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on returning home to grow crops to cope with their own retirement and medical problems, and have to support their families through other means.
Understanding the helplessness and toughness of over-age migrant workers "can't be idle" will help us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs and finding ways to make the returnees to the countryside truly realise that "the old have something to live for," requires shared responsibility in benign interactions between the public sector, the market and society, and a multi-pronged effort.
Russia will not export the system for the next five years because "it will first supply its own military, and export production will not take place thereafter," Chmaytsov said.
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, Gen. Yuri Glihov, deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's Sky Forces, said the system's development was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antay" Sky Defense Conthorn.
It's a new generation of air defense system that uses the working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that travel five times faster than sound, and even targets located near space.
The weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, particularly the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chmaytsov has expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in great demand in the world at the moment, but that Russian forces also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
Work has been completed on the refurbishment of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Newlands Arctic Air Defense Regiment, according to a Sept.
This is not Russia's militarisation of the Arctic.
Russia's defence ministry said it was all part of the process planned for a transition to more advanced defensive tools in the northern strategic direction.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has significantly increased," the Russian Northern Fleet News Service said.
Very importantly, the military has assessed the system's successful use in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air defence regiment officers and men have been trained for the new system and ready to enter combat duty.
The S-300 long-range air defense system, which was previously equipped there, is still partly retained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of aerial targets, whether they are high-speed targets in the outer stratosphere or "fish in a leaky net" approaching protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph, developed by Golden Diamond-Antay Air Defense Conchaun, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can strike aerodynamic targets at a range of 400km and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8km per second at a distance of 60km.
Russia has never hidden that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the polar north to secure its airspace over the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor (Tor)-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to Russia's Arctic, and they were enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen air defense systems in the region.
The Russian defence ministry said then that the arctic "Tor" force would be expanded to a full brigade-level structure in the future.
Combined with new S-400 long-range systems deployed to Newlands and the Kola peninsula, and short-range "Pantsir"-SA" systems deployed to the Arctic North, these advanced air defense weapons potently defend Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will struggle to breach this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own.
As the operator of Russian goods stores, Russia Pindor focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trading platforms in China have online stores in Tiancat (Tmall), JD (JD), 1688, Pinduduo (Pinduoduo), ShouQ (ShouQ), and Wechat, a multifunctional instant messaging software, as well as its own online platform, Epinduo.com, and Russian merchandise retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russia Pinto to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards and screen enterprises for products on virtual shelves.
Stores are scheduled to open by the end of the year and stock products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total number of monthly visits to China's electricity platforms is up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014 and will exceed $1 billion in 2018.
For now, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores selling goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
Merchandise from businesses with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more will be displayed in the new stores, according to Aleksey Khetnikov.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, 500 million roubles in sales is not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high quality and environmentally friendly products.
'The competition for Chinese consumers, who have a strong purchasing power, is fierce and intensifying, ' he said.
He said: "Our aim is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years."
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of enterprises in Russia's Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the basic faculty of trade policy at Russia's Plehanov Economic University, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export hubs are state-owned rather than private institutions."
"I don't see a lot of Russian goods that are very competitive in the market."
He believes the project is likely not to actually be implemented, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 Russian companies' product information has been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be bought in China or other countries, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, RIA Novosti reported.

Large-scale exhibitions will be held in the 1,000-square-metre exhibition hall, which will also serve as a hub for business project events, agreement signing ceremonies, promotional meetings and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The press office of the Russian Export Centre said: "In addition to the agricultural stands we will certainly hold business meetings, i.e. arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."

Xinhua Times Review: Steadfast in Taking Our Own Way
China's success in development over the past 70 years is rooted in the fact that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), have found the correct path of development with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow a development path that suits it.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness, internal and external worries, generations of benevolence scholars to find the way to save the country and rescue the people up and down the search, forward to follow.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the Restoration monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all been thought about, tried and failed to work".
Only with the Communist Party of China and the New China did the Chinese people gradually carve out a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path that China has taken is the path of the Chinese people's happiness, the path of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation and the path of China's common development with other countries in the world.
It is precisely on the right path that China can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, consistent with China's national conditions and adapted to the demands of the times, will more and more show bright development prospects as the times go forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it was to find the right path. Looking around the world, they cherish it even more.
The Chinese people know the truth of the north and the south, understand that what suits others may not suit themselves, only suits their own is the best.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created wonders that command the world's attention.
In the tortuous process of mankind's advance, "the end of history" was once famous.
Today, the success of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the "end of history", the collapse of the "China collapse doctrine" and the failure of the "socialist failure doctrine".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving a prosperous country with a strong people, expanded their path to modernization, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who want to speed up their development and maintain their independence, and follow a path consistent with their own national conditions.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose development paths appropriate to their national conditions.
Rather than "importing" foreign models or "exporting" Chinese models, China will steadfastly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen governance and political exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
A Foodworks supermarket boss whose practices were slammed as "shameful" after the Fair Work Commission found he sacked a 66-year-old female worker via text message because he preferred to hire people from Asian backgrounds has resigned.
The council said Ms Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who has worked at Wagga Wagga stores for more than 20 years, treated staff "extremely unfairly" and may have breached anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the shop in 2016, had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, the committee's vice-chairman, conducted an internet search and found "a number of job ads posted by Mr Wang in the past on various Australian Chinese employment forums."
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one reads "Asian ladies preferred" and the other "Asian staff preferred."
A third post said he was "more inclined to people overseas [sic]."
Mr Wang fired Ms Ayton in April via text message, later claiming it was due to her absence and an alleged cash register shortfall of between $5.10 and $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wong's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
She has missed only one shift in three years, and the "missed amount" amounts to a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms Ayton's dismissal "actually had nothing to do with her conduct or performance."
He said: "In my view, supported by the evidence in the recruitment ads released by Mr Wong, the defendant's real motive for firing her was his preference for staff with Asian backgrounds.
Under section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr Wong's conduct ostensibly constitutes a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or an unlawful dismissal of an applicant."
Mr Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr Wong to consider reinstating Ms Ayton given her "appalling" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, who is a casual worker earning A$26 an hour.
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his ruling and documents to the commission's director to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be passed on to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr Wong had not given Ms Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: "I believe that the respondent engaged in an irredeemably unfair and biased process to dismiss the applicant and that Mr Wong "waited" for the opportunity, which he believed would "justify" the termination of employment to the applicant."
"He was wrong ... that the Respondent, in dismissing the applicant, completely ignored any natural fairness accorded to her and, shockingly, perfunctory and grossly unfair."
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business, "it is important to be honest that no decent employer would fire an employee in a way that is grossly unfair and perfunctory, as acknowledged in this case."
He said: "This is disgraceful and deeply unfair."

Six denied selling fake salmon card birth papers to high court
Six men suspected of forging and selling China's passports, birth papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Names Registration Office and a businessman with the rank of governor, took their cases to the Supreme Court on Thursday, where magistrates approved charges relating to anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking of migrants.
The defence lawyer who originally represented the defendant, Li Zhenhua, also a Sunset Hole congressman, applied to the judge to withdraw from representing the defendant in the case, that is, to cease to be the defendant's attorney, and was granted permission in court.
He said he had drawn criticism from his political opponents for representing the defendant, and his Action Party had been implicated.
He stressed that the decision had been taken after careful consideration, having not feared any threat of its own but not wishing to be used by irresponsible units to smear the Action Party and the Greek Government or other Greek leaders.
He also said there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of parliament, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, who so far have not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged on September 12 this year and faced various charges under section 26E of the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration ordinance and section 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents). They all denied their guilt and were not granted bail pending trial.
On Thursday, Judge Noosaha, along with Mazlan, granted the prosecution's application to transfer the six defendants' allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration decrees to the high court following statements from both sides.
The six earlier defendants were arrested under the National Security Crimes (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.

The four criteria used to evaluate and rank cities' readiness to face the AI wave include outlook, capability to achieve, asset base and development direction.
The city of Singapore came in at number one, followed by cities in the UK, US, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert on behalf of the organisation, replied to reporters: <unk>淚 find it very meaningful to review and evaluate cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is bright against a backdrop of high growth, a strong economic development path and a fast-growing talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing well.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to further its economic development.
Artificial intelligence is completely changing how people work, communicate and live their lives.
It brings with it higher efficiency, but also threats that exacerbate social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, the only cities in the world today are ready for the breakthroughs that the AI era will bring.

World's oldest hairdresser dies at 108 after 96-year haircut
The 108-year-old Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest certified hairdresser by Gold's World Records, never retired to work every day on his clients' hair, but he died on Monday of complications from jaw cancer after 96 years of cutting hair.
According to CNN, Mansinelli emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, didn't take long to help clean the floor at a barber shop and began picking up scissors to serve guests when he was 12 as a way to relieve financial stress at home.
Mancinelli attended elementary school at the time but did not graduate.
Mansinelli's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and loved people from all over the world, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before he died because of medical conditions.
Robert, 82, says he now has to find a new hairdresser after his father's death because he's had his father help cut his hair all his life.
Repurchases of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan in year, a record high - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the company's share price and maintain its image, listed companies have begun frequent share repurchases in the past two years.Through targeted repurchases and assembly bidding, they hope to pass the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market, thus stabilizing the share price and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern WealthChoice data shows that the amount of money listed companies spent on share buybacks in 2017 was 7.9 billion yuan, jumping to 5.1 billion yuan in 2018, and the total amount of A-share repurchases implemented by listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan since 2019, the highest ever amount of A-share repurchases and well ahead of previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's share repurchase seems to be the same as the shareholder's increase, but there are great differences in implementing subject, fund source, use of repurchase and equity of stock.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mykerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., told reporters in Securities Daily that the "Opinion on Supporting Share Repurchase by Listed Companies" issued in November 2018, which addresses problems in the current system such as a narrow range of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures and an unsound inventory system, saw a huge increase in share repurchases that year because of previous policies to encourage listed companies to repurchase shares.
In January, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges formally issued the Rules for the Implementation of Share Repurchase by Listed Companies.These policies have broadened the sources of funds for share repurchase by listed companies, simplified the implementation procedures appropriately, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement share incentive or employee shareholding schemes.
After the opinions, listed companies to carry out share repurchase operations, with more applicable situations, simpler repurchase process, share repurchase enthusiasm is also greater.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies increase the efficiency of using funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, raising net asset yield and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings metrics.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is more meaningful than the increase of shareholders'holdings, which also reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow.
According to Xu Yang, undervalued share prices are the main factor for listed companies to repurchase.The stock prices of listed companies can no longer reflect their future prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but they should not invest blindly.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate the company's development confidence and capital strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for A-share repurchases by listed companies has also normalized repurchases, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the market.
Ping An recently disclosed the repurchase progress, saying the company has repurchased 57.59 million A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total share capital, through a centralized bidding exercise.The total amount of funds paid for the repurchase, totalling 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees), will all be used for the employee shareholding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been considered by the company's shareholders meeting.
Illy shares have paid $57.92 billion for share repurchase and have recently adjusted the use of share repurchase from the original plan to "all shares repurchased will be used as a source of late-stage equity incentives" to "a cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used as a source of late-stage equity incentives and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be written off to reduce registered capital."
Illy shares said writing off some of the shares it had repurchased would be conducive to further raising earnings per share and effectively boosting the return on investment for its shareholders.
TCL Group's repurchase progress announcement on September 25 showed it had bought back 3.59% of the company's shares at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The share buybacks will be used for employee shareholding programs, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies into shares, TCL Group's board office told Securities Daily.
TCL Group adheres to the established operating strategy, constantly improving its competitiveness and sustaining healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the preservation of investors' interests, the Company plans to repurchase its shares using proprietary funds, self-financing and other fund-raising methods, taking into account such factors as the performance of the Company's shares in the secondary market over the past year and taking into account the Company's operating and financial conditions.
Yang Delong, a former chief economist at Haikaiyuan Fund, said that on the one hand, the repurchase of shares by listed companies can reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market and increase earnings per share. On the other hand, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is an important positive for the secondary market.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the outstanding shares. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchase.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leading men in the engineering machinery manufacturing industry of the Hunan army--Jen Purexin, Liang Stegen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang have set a small goal to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster in the next three to five years.
In Changsha to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster, in the current fashionable words, is to build the "strongest surface. "
As the inland provincial capital city, Changsha shouted this brave words, the bottom of the breath?
On the strength of the despotic side.
The four Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue, each in its own hands, cover the whole field of sky, underground, sea and land: intelligent light aircraft in Shanhe, concrete conveying pumps in Zhonglian Heavy Industries, all-ground cranes in Trinity Heavy Industries and tunnel shielding machines in Iron Construction.
There was a time when China had little say in the making of engineering machinery.
Time flies, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go out" two-wheel drive, aboard the east wind of the "global economic development" initiative, acquisitions, mergers, plants and other multi-pronged, a leap into the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the leading enterprises in engineering machinery, such as Trinity Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries and Shanhe Intelligent, have taken a big lead in the major economic indicators such as output value, market share and sales.
It's the camera's control of the moment.
Xiangjun engineering machinery "Four Golden Gangs" , is the leader of the engineering machinery industry cluster in Changsha, is also the head of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the quagmire of global industry, who can survive, and live well, is the hard way to speak.
Earlier years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many well-known international engineering machinery manufacturers have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturers in Changsha "winter cat" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual, not only survived, but also strengthened the body.
On the basis of the star-studded government and enterprises together.
The development of dominant industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and governments to be active.
Changsha's reputation as the capital of engineering machinery lies in the fact that it has assembled the entire industrial chain from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, built many clusters of related industries and reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and marketing by optimizing the business environment, perfecting the supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, let the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come.
History has pushed Changsha to create the world's leading engineering machinery at the forefront of the level, time does not wait for me, when benevolent.
Neither the government, nor the enterprises, nor even the relevant producers, researchers and businessmen should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set their goals and continue to make efforts to contribute to the construction of a strong manufacturing country in Hunan.

Qingyang, Gansu Province: The lambs came with their burdens to "get rid of poverty. "
Autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
At the Yimin farming cooperative in Shima township, 58-year-old villager Xia Weili fills the sheep pen with the last shovel of grass and watches the white lake sheep chew.
"It's delicious. When the autumn and winter are full of fat, we can sell it at a good price. "
He feeds the sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, cleans them regularly, sterilizes them, and waits on them carefully without neglecting them, Mr. Chavelli said.
After raising sheep for more than 20 years, Chavelli didn't know how rough sheep used to be until he came to work for the co-op.
Xia Weili is a Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are all sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional scattered, poor quality sheep, small out of the column.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavily kept his nose to the grindstone of farming all day long, for he was always suffocating in his heart.
They trusted the sheep to the co-operative. They were all counting on him to pay their dividends and sell them at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to do epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, became the village's few breeding "good style. "
Yimin professional farming cooperative is a standardized cooperative, a total of 16 sheep sheds, breeding nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the co-operative's head, said the standardized sheep shed was well-established both inside and outside.
"The sheep's wool is thick and prone to breeding bacteria, and the lake sheep can't stay in hot and humid places. The sheep sheds have to be built on three sides of a circular ditch, and they have to be fitted with ventilators to ventilate and dissipate heat.
In order to prevent the epidemic, Zou Tao said, sheep sheds also need to be regularly sprayed with disinfection, to give sheep a quarter of three to four anti-epidemic needles.
Besides living well, the fat sheep have to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheatgrass and alfalfa, and have a wide enough playground to stretch their muscles.
Cooperatives have adopted the scheme of trusteeship and subsidy to guide local farmers to put well-bred sheep and goats into the area for unified breeding, management and marketing, so as to realize good breeding, scientific breeding, standardization and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poverty-stricken households with sheep shares receive more than 6,000 yuan in dividends each year.
From mountain grazing to precision feeding, from local mating to artificial insemination, from body-shaping and belly-touching to B-ultra-performance ... In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat sheep farming is not just a change in feeding patterns, the pattern of leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers has changed the scene that once "raising sheep on hillsides and selling sheep in markets" has overcome the weakness of traditional farming and animal husbandry, and farmers'poor days have become better because modern sheep farming.
If market prices are weak, said Zou, the local leader, Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., will buy at a market-protected price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu-based Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., said that by providing poor households with loan guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, quotation acquisition and unified processing and marketing services, enterprises are driving more and more poor households to read the "Sheep Sutra."
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poverty-stricken households have achieved steady increases in income through "joining in" China Sheng's farming and animal husbandry in grass breeding, seed breeding, scale breeding, slaughter splitting and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agriculture and animal husbandry interlaced zone, rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale meat-and-sheep farms and co-operatives in the city, with more than 5 million meat-and-sheep raised, and two processing lines on the scale of slaughtering 1.3 million meat-and-sheep have been set up.
France's Finance Minister Says Tax Cuts by More Than Billion euros Next Year, Calls on Germany to Follow
Paris September 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, while Germany should follow France's fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing initiatives created an opportunity for more investment for those member governments that could afford it.
The ECB cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart borrowing as it tries to keep borrowing costs down in hopes of spurring an economic recovery and boosting inflation.
"Low interest rates will not restore prosperity to Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient," Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs investment, it needs it now, as soon as possible. Don't wait for things to get worse, " he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, giving it a big boost to growth.
Germany's export-dependent economy has borne the brunt of the global economy's loss of momentum.
Le Maire noted that next year the tax burden on French households will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including a €5 billion income tax cut.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros as the corporate tax rate is phased in from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period.

Study: U.S. National Health Eating Index grows slightly but remains challenging - chinanews.com
(Reuters Health) - The U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown modestly from 56 to 58 in 16 years, according to a new study.
But with a full score of 100, it's not a cause for celebration.
U.S. nationals still face "significant challenges" with their diets.
Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and one of the study's authors, said Americans are still eating too much of the foods that can cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are among the most common among U.S. citizens.
24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study is based on the findings of a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016.
"Despite significant improvements," the authors wrote, "significant dietary challenges persist."
The challenges are understood to include getting US nationals to cut back on snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended limit of 10 per cent.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but it was still too high.
Officially, added sugar intake should be less than 10 per cent of the daily diet.
The reason for the decrease in sugar consumption, researchers believe, is linked to a decrease in people drinking sweetened fizzy drinks, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults saw small increases in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grains.
However, figures for 2016 show that these foods still make up less than 5 per cent of the daily diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and lower consumption of fruit juices leading to lower-quality carbohydrates, Zhang says they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white breads and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that ask adults to recall the food they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government-issued Dietary Guidelines for American Residents recommend adopting a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and protein-rich seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs and seeds.
During the study period, the number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled, to more than 7 percent, and the obesity rate increased over the years -- about 70 percent of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Furthermore, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among U.S. nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Member of the Political Bureau of Viet Cong, Secretary of the Central Secretariat and Minister of the Central Ministry of Economy Nguyen Man-ping led the delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the forum was "Docking between the EU and Asia: Building Bridges for the Future of Sustainable Development".
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the docking strategy between the EU's two continents.
Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said the strengthening was part of the argument because of the benefits it brings to the peoples and economies concerned.
The above-mentioned relations will help bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes the EU wants to convey messages about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial docking relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of honour at the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary.
China's first joint-stock banking subsidiary sets up technology-fuelled capital management business
26 (Xinhua) -- Guangda Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Guangda Finance Co., Ltd., was formally established in Qingdao, the first joint-stock bank finance subsidiary in China.
Experts say that asset management is an important area of financial technology development, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries is conducive to the use of technology to enhance the management of business.
In April, Guangda Bank and China Merchants Bank separately announced that they had received approval from the CBRC to set up a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24th Kwong announced that Kwong Financial had been officially allowed to open.
Just 2 days later, Guangda Bank led a number of joint-stock banks, the first in Qingdao to set up Guangda Finance.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Kwangmyong Group, said the group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern technological thinking and means, rely on big data, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and enhance the customer's sense of access, well-being and security.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four pillars" of China's financial science and technology development, further enhance the application capability of financial science and technology, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Guangdong Provincial People's Bank of China, said the management platform of Guangdong Provincial People's Bank of China will use such technologies as intelligent patronage, intelligent research and large data to help Guangdong Provincial People's Bank of China better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, we will also apply new technologies such as blockchain to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a specially appointed researcher at the National Laboratory of Finance and Development, said that in the face of a new competitive situation in the capital management industry, financial technology companies and institutions will use capital management technology to explore new growth paths together.
It is not only the need of the transformation of finance technology itself, but also the new vitality and vitality for the development of finance management.
Earlier this year, the company launched a new capital management technology system to enhance its product R&D and wind control capabilities with the help of technology and digital tools.
The new system starts with the ability of product design, sales and transactions, asset management and risk assessment, and enhances the intellectualized operational level of the capital management industry as a whole.
Experts believe that while improving customer service capabilities and innovative products, management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve management efficiency.
Whereas in the past risk preferences of customers were easily skewed by using questionnaires, the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits is helping to better position customers and rolling out corresponding products based on their investment preferences is helping to defuse risk, according to Zhang.
"Another kind of big data, such as power generation and spatial and temporal data, can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. "
Zhang Xuyang said that while defusing risks, large-scale data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest rail tunnel shaft recorded
(Zhang Weiming Xu for Guo Zhou Jingbo)After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the excavation of the Gaoligongshan tunnel shaft 1 on Jiandao Rui Railway completed on September 27 with the depth reaching 762.59 meters below ground level, breaking the record for the deepest tunnel shaft in China, which was set amid a flood of water.
Located in Yunnan Province, the 34.5-kilometer-long Tairui Railway tunnel runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the coast of Jiangxi Province, making it the longest single tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel traverses 19 faults and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, as it covers almost all of the adverse geology and significant risks that tunnel construction may encounter, with the High Ridge Tunnel known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, which shoulders the important task of increasing the operating surface to realize the "short run of the long tunnel" and ventilation of the later railway operation.
The successful excavation of Shaft 1 to the bottom of the tunnel marks the formal entry of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction.After the excavation of the underground vehicle yard and the replacement of equipment, four additional operating surfaces can be added under the tunnel to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The shafts are all in granite formations, because there are more cracks in the granite formations, there is no stopping the flow of water from the top to the bottom. Basically, the depth of the well depends on the pressure of the water.
Si Jingzhao, Chief Engineer of the Da Rui Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the shaft construction, there were many accidents such as mud inrush and water collapse.
"At its peak, the shaft surges to more than 300 cubic meters per hour, at a depth of more than 700 meters, at a pressure equivalent to 700 meters below sea level. "
"If we don't pump and drain the water in time, we'll flood a well of 10 meters in an hour," he said. "We spend almost 85 percent of our time treating water and 15 percent of our time digging in.
In order to overcome the problems of the longitudinal joint development of the perimeter rock of No.1 shaft, the inrush of mud and the flooding of water-rich granite, the systemic water control measures combining exploration, injection and excavation were adopted to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of Shaft 1 has formed a mechanized pipeline of excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch lifting system.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 meters.
The Da Rui Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "China-Pacific Economic Cooperation" .
When it is completed, the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from six hours to two hours on the current highway.This will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western part of Yunnan, and play a catalytic role in promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

State Council press office releases 'China and the world in a new era' white paper
27 (Xinhua) -- On the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the State Council Information Office released the white paper "China and the World in a New Era."
Xu Lun, vice minister of the Ministry of Communications and director of the State Council Information Office, said the white paper focuses on issues such as "where China came from and where China is going" "what kind of world China is pushing for" and "how a developing China gets along with the world," providing a systematic introduction of China's development achievements, development path and direction, and elaborating in-depth on China's relations with the world so as to enhance the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.
The white paper notes that over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China has undergone tremendous changes and created unprecedented development miracles in the history of mankind.
Through a wealth of data and facts, the white paper introduces the great achievements, significance and world contributions of China's development over the past 70 years.
The white paper noted that it took China decades to complete the course of development that developed countries have gone through for hundreds of years, with the total economy leaping to number two in the world, nearly 1.4 billion people escaping material shortages and overall reaching a moderately prosperous level, enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights.

Is Ma Hua up for a byelection in the conference seat of Denver?
Governor of Ma Hua General Director Sri Wei Jiaxiang: " to the National Front Supreme Council discussions! "
With the by-election of the State Council of Dandong Biai imminent, it is of concern whether the National Front's Ma Hua will take the traditional State Council seat.
However, after a meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the National Front would decide whether the traditional Ma Hua seat should continue to be taken up by Ma Hua or replaced by other members of the Party.
Speaking to the media after presiding over a meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Wei said any by-election would be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP), which require a decision to be made through a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said the NFU's top council meeting is expected to be held in early October, as the electoral commission will not meet until next Monday to finalize the by-election.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with National Front Chairman Governor Nasri Amozahi and we all agreed on the need to retake the seat from the Hope League. "
"We are scheduled to convene a special National Front leaders' meeting in early October, and the three-party leader of the National Front will determine which member party will take the field.
Asked whether Ma Hua would insist on taking up the traditional seat in the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei reiterated that, as the Chairman of the National Front, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and therefore any decision must be made by consensus of the National Front.
"In any by-election, it's a common occurrence that someone is willing to go out, there's a political party, there's a certain side that thinks they should come out.""
"The most important thing is from what organizations and political alliances? "
"This is the test of our years of forming a political coalition, and we believe that the National Front has stood up for some valuable values along the way. "
"It's no surprise that someone might say something in the process," he said.
"But once the supreme council of FRAPH has made its decision, everyone must prepare for war with all their might, and that is what is most precious. "
In any case, Mr. Wei said, Ma Hua will make every effort to prepare for the upcoming by-election by the District Council, the State Council and the Central Committee.
"On the part of the District Councils, the Chairman of the District Council (Dan绒 Biai) Mr. Natsuo Sri Wong Il-sung will lead; the State Council will be headed by Mr. Natsuo Lam Pei-hing, Acting Chairman of the Legislative Council of Yuezhou; and the Central Committee will be deployed personally by Mr. Natsuo Ma Han-shun, Acting Chairman of the Legislative Council of Yuezhou, and the General Secretary, Mr. Zhang Sheng-sheng," he said.

A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, has been ordered to " patrol the mountains "
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to pay 15420 yuan (RMB, the same as below) in compensation for environmental damage to ecological resources.
Because the defendant's family was poor, the procuratorial organs used alternative labor to compensate the ecological restoration expenses, thus realizing the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy attorney general of the public prosecutor's office of Baokang County, said Sunday that through three months of "compulsory mountain-walking" and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou had developed deep feelings with wild monkeys and hunting animal behavior before deeply self-reproach.
On June 21 this year, a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit in the field of ecological resources, filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Baukang County, was heard in public and sentenced in the county court.
Zhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, suspended for four years, and fined 3000 yuan, while ordered to pay 15420 yuan in compensation for environmental damage to ecological resources.
After inspection, Zhou began to set up a grid at the cliffs in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including wildebeest, small suede and crested deer.
Antelopes are classified as endangered wildlife in the state, and small suede and crested deer are listed in the National Register of Land Wildlife Conservation.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his wrongful facts and behavior, and willing to bear the incidental civil liabilities.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, the local village committee, the forest station and Zhou reached an alternative labor compensation agreement under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Bakang County.
For the prosecutor's recommendation, the court expressed its approval, agreeing to Zhou's probation while actively fulfilling "alternative labor compensation ecological repair costs" obligations.
At present, Zhou has been in the macaque sanctuary for 3 months of voluntary labor, active mountain tour, good performance.
In recent years, the procuratorates of Bakang county have integrated procuratorial functions and social governance in practice, scientifically applied procuratorial suggestions, investigative supervision and litigation supervision, so as to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts by judicial means.
The United Nations awards the Earth Defender Award to the Ant Forest.
Amid loud applause and loud music, project leader Xu De and user representative Shen Junliang took to the podium to receive the trophy from the presenter of the 2019 United Nations "Guardians of the Earth Award".
26 (UPI) -- An ant forest project that uses small mobile phone programs to get hundreds of millions of people involved in environmental activism has won the Encouragement and Action Award at the 2019 Earth Defenders Awards in New York.
The UN Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in the Kenyan capital Nairobi a week ago, but it was hard to hide the excitement among those attending the ceremony.
The ant forest is an exciting innovation that puts hundreds of millions of people in action to understand the environmental challenges faced by mankind and what mankind can do for the environment, Ying Er Anoxing, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, told Xinhua.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in protecting the planet, and that will have a huge impact.
Launched in August 2016 on the Alipay platform by China's Ant Financial Services Group (hereinafter referred to as Ant Goldwear), Ant Forest enables users to "plant trees" on their phones by accumulating "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their green journeys in their daily lives and paying for utilities online.
For every virtual tree created by users, the " ant forest" and its public-interest partners plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August this year, 500 million "ants forest" users had reduced their carbon emissions by 792 million tonnes and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who arrived to receive the award for his country's environmental efforts, said the ant forest's contribution was "impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green action.
The Earth Defender Award is an affirmation of the Ant Forest project, according to Yoshiyuki Ii, chairman and chief executive of Antskin.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, an honor that belongs to all participants.
Mr Yip said the ant forests had affected 500 million people over the past three years and the goal for the next three years was to drive a billion people around the world into low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from green mountains and water.
In addition to providing jobs through tree planting, it hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural development projects and electricity generation platforms.
The digital technology-based environmental protection model created by Ant-forest has also been successfully used by other countries.
In June, GCash, the Philippines" largest "e-wallet," launched a Filipino version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
Working with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental advocacy groups and others, GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, it said.
The "Guardians of the Earth Award" is the UN's highest award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually.
The Ant Forest award is the third year in a row that a green innovation project from China has been awarded the Incentive and Action Award, following in the footsteps of China's Sehanba forest site builder and China's Zhejiang Province's Thousand Villages Demonstration and Million Villages Remediation Project.
Economic and trade frictions affect U. S. economic "result sheet" .
US GDP growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter, hurt by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, according to the economy's "result sheet" for the second quarter.
Analysts point to economic and trade frictions and uncertainty as the main cause of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, the final revised figures released by the Commerce Department showed on Thursday, unchanged from previous revisions but significantly lower than the 3.1 percent growth recorded in the first quarter.
Consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. growth in the second quarter, the data showed.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, expanded 4.6 percent in the quarter, driving growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drive economic growth by 0.82 percentage point.
However, private sector investment slipped 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down growth by 1.16 percentage points, while exports slipped 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter and net exports dragged down growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner at Macroeconomic Advisors in Aynside, said not only had private sector investment failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, it had fallen sharply, as rising economic friction and uncertainty hit business confidence.
Mr Knapp believes U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downward trend next year amid policy uncertainty.
While consumer growth provided a strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, analysts believe there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the U.S. consumer outlook.
In the latest survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a year-and-a-half high, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who led the survey.
For the future U.S. economic trends, analysts generally believe the U.S. economy will continue to slow.
But experts also say the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions are eased.
Kathleen Burch, a global economist at the think tank British Economists, expects the U.S. economy to continue its gradual downward trend this year and grow at a lower rate than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts growth of 2.3 per cent this year and a further slowdown to 1.6 per cent next, assuming economic frictions do not continue to escalate.
Alan Hatzen, investment manager at Patnam Investments, noted that the biggest concern for companies right now is trade and economic disputes and the uncertainty they bring, and that if trade and economic disputes are resolved, uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the industrial sector will perform much better than it is now.
Matt Plumlee, equity strategist at Miller-Tabac Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions remained the "top issue" and the main cause of the large volatility in U.S. capital markets this year, and whether they are properly addressed will be key to how the U.S. capital markets move for the rest of the year.
Ningxia to create joint parental leave for couples 10 days a year for parents of 0 to 3-year-olds
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the 12th Standing Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote.
This is Ningxia's first provincial-level enactment and promulgation of a comprehensive system of local regulations to safeguard women's legitimate rights and interests, will be formally implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations, which were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007, are divided into nine chapters and 65 articles, including general rules, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and bylaws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, a first in the country.
The "Guidelines on Promoting the Development of Baby Care Services for Children Under 3 Years of Age" issued by the State Council's General Office in April this year describes co-parenting.
Ningxia, in the process of amending the Regulations, innovatively proposed to "encourage the employing units to grant each husband and wife ten days of joint parental leave each year for the period between the ages of zero and three years of age to the husband and wife who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlighted anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the codification of personality rights in China's current civil code, and details the constitutional elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance specifically prohibits the frequency of vicious incidents of sexual assault on girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, thus becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about joint property and the obligations of property registration institutions and related subjects, thus providing solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
Furthermore, in response to the hot social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination but also prohibits indirect discrimination.
In recent years, the Ministry of Public Inspection, Civil Affairs and other departments of the Ningxia Women's Federation have promoted and introduced social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and anti-domestic violence, with remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and promote this, and in various articles of law encourage the mobilization of social forces and accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.

A team of six experts from Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Agricultural and Rural Affairs Office sampled and harvested the "Xing salt series" rice.
After expert assessment, the average acre of salt-tolerant rice yielded 508.8 kg on land with pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity content of 5‰ to 6‰.
"Our next step is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's trials and re-create and optimize saline and alkaline-tolerant rice varieties so as to achieve better quality and higher yields," said Wang Shigang, executive station director of the workstation of Yuan Longping, an academician of the Xing'an Alliance.
"On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that saline-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on saline-alkali soil," said Lai Yongcai, a researcher and vice-president of Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Xing'an alliance belongs to the southern foothills of Daxing'an Mountain, which is a concentrated and intensively afflicted area.
In October 2018, Academician Yuan Longping's work station was unveiled by the Xing'an Alliance.
Yuan led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest breed of salt-tolerant and alkaline hybrid rice and advanced technology, and to build a 960-acre salt-tolerant and alkaline rice base at the Chinese flag on the right wing of Qinqin.
The field measurement of salt-tolerant rice not only injects hope to the high- and medium-yielding saline and low-yielding saline fields in Xing'an Alliance, but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline and alkaline rice under the same conditions in China.
After marathon debates and weeks of protests, Australia's newest state passed a law legalizing abortion on September 26, local time, according to AusNet.
The bill is understood to have sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with serious divisions in the Australian Liberal Party emerging since independent MP for Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of deliberations, the ANZ Senate passed the abortion legalisation bill by a vote of 26 to 14 on the night of the 25th, making it the third-longest-considered bill in the NSW Senate, it has been reported.
26 morning, after a final vote in the New State House of Representatives to make abortion legal in the new state.
The bill allows a woman to terminate a pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation and also allows an abortion later in the pregnancy if two doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment on the night of the 25th that would allow doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of the hospital advisory board before performing an abortion on a woman 22 weeks into her pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include the requirement that doctors provide appropriate care for babies who survive terminations.
The move follows public criticism from conservatives over the legislation from new Gov. Berry Gicklin, who stepped in several times to get more debate time for the bill, but she did not show up for the final vote.
Defending her absentee ballot, Ms Berejiklian said: "I need to spend time running the whole new state."
Mr Davis, an Australian Liberal MP who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, is understood to have threatened to quit the new state government over the legislation, saying it triggered a "government crisis."

Davis said: "The content of the amendments to the abortion legalization bill that were introduced in the House on the morning of 26th actually provides more safeguards for women, doctors."
Meanwhile, Australian New State National Party leader John Barilaro said he was proud to be part of the government that legalised abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, making abortion legal, it's no longer a crime and it's not treating women who have abortions as criminals," he said.

Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state funds to enrich social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed transferring some of their state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, totaling about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Tuesday.
Liu made the remarks at a joint meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Administration of Finance on the deployment of the National Social Security Fund for the replenishment of some state-owned capital.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full expression of the achievements of state-owned enterprises' development and the universal sharing of the basic old-age insurance system and an intergenerational fairness, and a policy measure that is based on the present and takes into account the long-term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Program for Turning Some State-Owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund," which requires selecting some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, positive results have been achieved in the early stage of the transfer.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred in three batches, transferring about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital.
Among them, the transfer of the central financial institutions of the Ministry of Finance to carry out the responsibilities of contributors has been basically completed.
Central enterprise transfer has a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces has basically been completed, transferring state capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.8 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step.
According to a joint notice issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds by the central and local governments will be fully rolled out in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting convened that day made specific deployments to move forward with the overall delineation.
The meeting stressed that the transfer work should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"According to the schedule, the delineation will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
It's a tight schedule and a heavy task.
All regions and departments should organize and arrange carefully to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, press ahead with the work, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy, strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner, Liu said.
Transferring State Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund Starting from the point of "enriching the purse of the Social Security Fund," the goal is to provide strong support for the old-age insurance.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but a "mathematical addition" .
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights, the State-owned Capital Commission, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice Concerning the Comprehensive Expansion of the Work of Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enhance Social Security Fund.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented very quickly.
On September 25th, the Ministry of Finance transferred to the Social Security Fund all 10 percent of the holdings of ICBC and Agricultural Bank, with the total value of the two transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan.
According to regulations, social security foundations and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the rights of income, disposal and informed rights of state-owned equity.
In the announcement, ICBC and Agricultural Bank said the changes in equity will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author thinks that the similar state-owned enterprises' equity transfer is not a simple change of ownership, but a series of effects can be stimulated by "plus operations. "
The first step of social security transfer of some state-owned enterprises is "adding results", which can reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people and the sharing of development achievements by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously achieved to do better to do stronger.
On July 10, the State Council's executive meeting decided to move forward the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in an all-round way this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said it would, in line with relevant departments and in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, do a good job in promoting the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, so as to fully embody the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and the common sharing of the development achievements of state-owned enterprises.
The second step, "plus results", is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state funds transferred are capable of sustained profits and dividends, which not only can effectively replenish the social security funds, but also provide the source of live water for the social security funds.
Some calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, one percentage point can be reduced to support enterprises' basic endowment insurance contribution and deposit.
The third step of the rotation, "additional results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
This transfer undertakes the main body to obtain the income way is "the main dividends, as a supplementary operations. "
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, do receive dividends mainly on equity.
However, social security funds, as value investors in capital markets, have a strong capability of capital operation.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which is conducive to raising the operating level of enterprises and will have a positive and positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, social security funds as a vanguard of investment, the enhancement of the stake in the market is conducive to further enhance its influence in the market, and play a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, guiding investors to invest rationally and in value.

U.S. Senate approves Scalia as labor secretary - Xinhua
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to approve President Donald Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as labor secretary.
The vote was 53 to 44, with no Democrats voting for Scalia.

Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Labor Secretary, announced his resignation in July amid huge public opinion pressure over allegations that US billionaire Geoffrey Epstein had been given "leniency" over the alleged sexual assault and abduction of teenage girls.
Scalia, 56, is a partner at a prominent U.S. law firm whose father was the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Labor Department is the cabinet-level branch of the U. S. federal government responsible for labor-related affairs and so on.
The White House also issued a statement that day saying Trump had nominated Peter Geithner, acting director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, to formally lead the agency.
Guided by procedure, Geithner's nomination also has to be approved by the Senate of Congress.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, under the Department of Homeland Security, coordinates federal resources for emergency response and follow-up to natural disasters and terrorist attacks in the United States.

Iran Confirmed to Develop Advanced Centrifuge, Further Suspends Implementation of Iran Nuclear Deal
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that Iran had violated the Iranian nuclear deal once again by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, China Central News Agency (CBS) reported.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the limits of the Iranian nuclear deal in response to U.S. President Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the resumption and tightening of Iranian sanctions.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and to enrich uranium with a purity of no more than 3.67 per cent.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran will only have about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and will only be allowed to use a small number of more advanced models for research but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to enrich uranium several times faster, possibly for a nuclear bomb.
The IAEA report stated: "On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that advanced centrifuges of Iranian R&D aircraft Models 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
"They are busy at the [Natanz uranium enrichment] facility," a diplomatic official said in response to the report, which was presented to Member States by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
(New China 70 years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
With China's overall national strength and international influence rising rapidly, the white paper says, there are international fears that China will go down the road of "state-by-state hegemony" and some have come up with the so-called "China threat theory."
There are cognitive misreading, deep-seated biases, psychological imbalances resulting from strengthening, and deliberate distortions aimed at preserving one's vested interests.
The realization of national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of all peoples.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge."
The White Paper noted that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new kinetic energy into world economic growth, and the role of China's economy as a stabilizer and power source in the future is even more prominent.
At present, world economic growth is under-motivated, and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to sound economic development.New industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization have been accelerated, economic structure has been deeply adjusted, industrial optimization has been continuously upgraded, and new economic growth points have emerged.
<unk>he McKinsey Global Research Institute study argues that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world is expected to generate $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15 per cent to 26 per cent of the global economy, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create enormous economic value.<unk>?
The white paper stresses that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for world economic development.
Seeing China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge," trying to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains and "decoupling" China from the world economy is neither feasible nor harmful.
The white paper points out that all-directional opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend."
China has steadfastly pursued a win-win strategy of opening to the outside world with greater intensity and at a higher level.China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and more large-scale "going out" benefits more countries.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and for the benefit of one party.
A mutually beneficial two-way street can last a long time.
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection,' the white paper said.
Only when all sides act in a mutually beneficial way can we create an environment for development that is open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger so as to form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality co-operation in the development of the "China-Pacific Economic Partnership", establishing a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China has benefited from the development of the international community and has always given back to the family of nations to provide more and better public goods for the international community.

Egyptian demonstrators blast president as rains threaten to fall Authorities show strong crackdown
Twitter subject tags and social media are heavily advocating for Egyptians to take to the streets today in a peaceful plea for President Morsi to step down.
But authorities have indicated they intend to use force to crack down.
Since Mr. Sessions, then the army chief, seized power in a military coup in 2013, dissent has all but evaporated in Egypt, and any kind of protest is in extreme danger.
The British newspaper The Guardian reported that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, noted that more than 1,900 people had been arrested since a rare eruption of protests over the weekend calling for Mr. Sesi to step down.
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on the 20th over corruption allegations that Mr. Sessions and his family squandered public money in pursuit of vanity.
Egypt's interior ministry yesterday stood firm and said it would not be soft on any attempts to destabilize the country.
Downtown Cairo has long been heavily fortified, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes officers dotting the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's 2011 revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces on the 25th detained a number of important academics and social scholars, including Cairo University political science professor and prominent columnist Nafa.
He had tweeted on 24th: "Continuing to give Cersei absolute rule will be disastrous, I have no doubt about that."
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately.""
Hosni, who served as spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Anan, was detained before Nafa's arrest.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Sethi for the presidency.
Davutoglu, the president of the Constitutional Party, was also detained.
Analysts and political figures argue that the sweep of dissidents reflects government instability and fragility at a time of heightened economic woes for the poor and middle class.
"The capture highlights the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears," said Ayman Nour, an opposition leader who once ran for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, combined with widespread political oppression, Mr. Sessions is trying to send a clear message to important generals and politicians who might be replaced."
Mr Knoll said the government's high-handed tactics would only increase people's anger if the socio-economic situation continued to deteriorate.
Now that the fear barrier has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor now in exile in Spain who was a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military, began uploading a series of videos at the beginning of the month boasting of benefiting from government corruption, setting off a wave of small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Mr. Ali said his company, Amrak General Contracts, did not have to go through a statutory tender process to get lucrative contracts, stressing graft by the military and members of Mr. Sessions's family, including the first lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful that he had been part of it.
Ali claimed that he had helped Sethi Gai's opulent palaces and luxury hotels stand in stark contrast to the abject poverty of Egyptians today, and that he had not yet paid for them.
Theme tags on Twitter such as "Stand up You're Not Alone," "Sisi You're Over," "Sisi Got to Roll," and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling for people to take to the streets peacefully to demand Mr. Sessions's ouster.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amar Wake's tweet has nearly 7 million followers.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed... he's done and his supporters are making a big mistake now."

There is no small matter of overseas peace, a leaf always concerns the feeling.
The number of Chinese citizens going abroad has increased dramatically in the past 70 years, from less than a million a year before the introduction of reform and opening-up to more than 100 million a year today, Cui said.At the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens traveling abroad has become more secure, and the work of consular protection and assistance has expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, tourists, overseas students and migrant workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th Party Congress, we have organized more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, and safely evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens were handled and coordinated.
In times of danger, the motherland can take you home; the idea of a "walk-on-walk trip" is no longer a dream.

These include agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina to issue 10-year valid multiple visas for travel and business personnel, and two-year multiple visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for travel, business and family visits.
The UK and Belgium have jointly launched a "one-stop visa" service, with France, Italy and Singapore cutting their acceptance times to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours respectively.
For business travelers who often go abroad, the APEC Business Travel Card with multiple entry and easy customs clearance is a good choice.
Holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas in 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific for five years, and is of great significance for business people, especially private enterprises, to "go out," Cui said.
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in effective card-holding.

After two months in Iranian custody, the British tanker Stena Empire was finally released and set off from Iran's port of Abbas on the morning of 27 for international waters.
In the middle of last month, authorities in Gibraltar, Britain's overseas territory, released an Iranian oil tanker that had been held captive for more than a month.
The British tanker Stena Empire departed from the port of Abbas at 9 a.m. local time for international waters in the Persian Gulf, according to the Islamic Republic of Iran news agency.
The port and shipping organization in Iran's Hormuzgan province confirmed that the ship's commanders and crew had made formal and written commitments and that they had no claims despite the seizure of the vessel.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of the tanker Stena Empire, also said the vessel was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition,finitiv's ship tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on 27 and left the port of Abbas.
The British-flagged Stena Impero tanker was seized by Iran in July.
A company spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar, Iran's Revolutionary Guards detained the vessel, named Stena Impero, on the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released Aug.
Earlier this week, an Iranian government spokesman had said all legal proceedings required for the release of the Stena Empire had been completed.
But Iran said the investigation was still ongoing.
Multiple Iranian media outlets have also released videos of the tanker setting sail.
On July 19, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy detained a British oil tanker, the Stena Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz before escorting it to the port of Abbas.
Iranian oil tanker Grace One has been detained off the coast of Gibraltar.
Furthermore, on July 4, authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized the tanker Grace One carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of carrying oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
On August 15, more than a month later, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace One.
This afternoon, the province's undergraduate colleges and universities thematic education inspection and rectification of the work of the conference held in Changsha.
Ulan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, emphasized improving political standing, strengthening political responsibility, strictly and honestly grasping problems, inspecting and correcting themes, and promoting higher education with the effectiveness of thematic education in Party building, thought-government, reform and development.
Ulan fully affirms the initial results achieved by undergraduate universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that the major deployment made by the CPC Central Committee is to carry out the "not forgetting the first heart and remembering the mission" thematic education, and that undergraduate colleges and universities should deeply study and implement the important spirit of the CPC Central Committee on carrying out the "not forgetting the first heart and remembering the mission" thematic education.
From strengthening the "four consciousnesses", realizing the "two maintenance", and carrying out the primary mission of politics, we will conscientiously complete all the prescribed actions on the subject of education, especially the series of problems examined through solid rectification, and coordinate all aspects of school reform and development so as to achieve "two corrections and two promotions".
Ulan stressed that we should keep the edge of the knife inward, take good care of the problems, follow the requirements of "four contrasts" and "one for the four", seek advice from teachers, students, parents and all sectors of the community on the alignment of standards and tables, open our mouths widely, solicit opinions and suggestions from teachers, students, staff, parents and all sectors of the community, analyze seriously and deeply the causes of the problems, then make clear the direction of our efforts and improve measures, and come up with practical ways to solve the difficult problems.
To insist on precise efforts, strengthen genuine reform and real reform, the word "reform" throughout.
It is necessary to do a good job of combining the thematic education with the work of "Li De Shu Ren" and so on, to enforce the responsibility of corrective action, to ensure that the problem remains unsolved and the bottom is clear and zero, so as to make corrective action effective.
We must adhere to the principle of treating as much as possible, improve the long-term mechanism, tighten the institutional cage, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, ensure that we have rules and regulations to follow in all our work, and truly use the system to administer people and affairs.
To uphold the above rate, leading cadres should take the lead in strengthening theoretical arming, taking the lead in conscientious inspection and rectification, taking the lead in strictly observing the law from time to time, giving play to the demonstration role of the "key minority" and striving to complete the tasks of inspection and rectification of thematic education.
Statements were made by the responsible comrades of the Party committees of Hunan University and other five universities, as well as by the responsible comrades of the departments directly concerned.
"One crossing all the time" two major high-pressure engineering deliveries
26, quasi-east to southern Anhui Province±1100 kV high-voltage direct current transmission projects, Sutong 1000 kV AC GIL composite pipe gallery project delivery.
Both of these projects occupy the high point in the field of transmission technology in the world, which will greatly enhance China's energy allocation.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the State Energy Administration, said the project from the Jungdong to the southern Anhui Province is the world's largest power transmission capacity and the furthest distance from the project.
Its transportation is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensure the electric power supply in eastern China.
GIL, or gas-insulated metal, seals the transmission lines.
Sutong Pipeline Corridor Project has set the record for the highest voltage grade and the strongest transmission capacity in the world for GIL Project.
According to the National Grid Corporation, the project from the quasi-east to southern Anhui Province will carry electricity over a distance of 3324 kilometers.
With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost on the way, and the project has been developed to greatly increase the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000km.
After the project is launched, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, thus helping solve the problem of absorbing new energy resources in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, this line alone will deliver between 600 and 850 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, enough to supply more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
Sutong GIL Comprehensive Pipe Corridor Project is a controlled project of superhigh voltage AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
A conventional overhead line across the river would require the erection of two giant towers of more than 450 meters across the river, and an artificial island of more than four football pitches for each.
In response, National Grid boldly innovated, developing a compact THV AC GIL transmission technology, through tunnels from underwater river crossing, avoiding the impact on the Golden Channel.
The two projects promoted China's electrical equipment manufacturing capability to achieve a new leap.
At present, the National Grid has accumulated "10 to 11 direct" super-high voltage projects, and "4 to 3 direct" in the construction.
FX: Continuous Optimization of China's Foreign Debt Structure Strengthening the Stability of Foreign Debt
"Overall, China's external debt structure has been continuously optimized and its stability has increased. "
Wang Chunying, a spokeswoman for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and chief economist, said the main indicators of China's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safe line, and the foreign debt risk is generally manageable.
Wang Chunying made the remarks in response to a reporter's question on the day the Foreign Exchange Bureau released its foreign debt data for the end of June 2019.
The figures show that by the end of June 2019, China's total foreign debt balance, including domestic and foreign currencies, stood at US$98 billion, an increase of US$26.3 billion from the end of March 2019 and a 1.3 percent increase, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of China's full-caliber foreign debt increase was driven by non-residents buying domestic renminbi bonds, and the majority of non-residents were mainly medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, medium- and long-term foreign debt accounted for an increase of 3 percentage points compared with the end of March 2019, and local currency foreign debt accounted for an increase of 1 percentage point compared with the end of March 2019.

Reporter 27 from Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences to understand that the current Yunnan grassland night moth has been effectively prevented and controlled, did not cause a large-scale outbreak into disaster, the prevention and control work achieved phased results.
The grass-growing night moth, first detected in January in Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province, and later confirmed in 129 counties, is also gradually spreading from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moth is an important long-distance migratory agricultural pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a major migratory pest for global warning by FAO and has the characteristics of "international, migratory, outbreaking and destructive" .
The pest harms more than 80 crops, such as corn, sugarcane and sorghum, and can cause up to 70 percent of production losses.
It is difficult to control the insect. There is no registered pesticide to control the insect in China.
Since the invasion of the grassland night moth in Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Cheng Aidong to lead the cross-border harmful organisms of agriculture of the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in collaboration with the innovation team of the province for green control and prevention.
Team Cheng Aidong has mastered the population characteristics, natural enemy insect resources, overseas source characteristics, population migration trajectory, pharmaceutical toxicity and field control effect, etc.
They have actively carried out research and application of green control technologies.Through the implementation of new green control technologies such as population monitoring, adult insect induction, scientific drug use and agronomic measures, the effectiveness of the control measures in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, and the use of chemical pesticides has been reduced, natural enemy resources and the ecological environment have been protected, thus providing Yunnan with technical guarantee for effective control of the outbreaks of grassland night moths and sustainable management.
At present, Yunnan grassland night moth has been effectively prevented and controlled, did not cause large-scale outbreaks and disasters, the prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
Next, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism of population migration and invasive outbreaks, breakthrough the establishment of biological control and green control technology system.

White Paper: China Steps Out of a Developing Road Consistent with National Conditions
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council Information Office on Tuesday released a white paper on China and the world in a new era.
The white paper notes that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have painstakingly explored and stepped forward, successfully blazed the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved developmental achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
'China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work,' the white paper said.
China's development depends on the do-it-yourself spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing", which has been followed by generations of continuous struggle, involving unimaginable toil and sweat; on the bearing spirit of "carrying one's own burden," whether in good times or bad, not exporting problems, passing on contradictions, not plundering other countries by forcing them to buy and sell; on the exploratory spirit of "touching a stone and crossing a river" and not following the old path of imperialism and colonialism, not copying the development model of Western countries, but combining China's realities, summing up its experience and lessons, learning from human civilization, and daring to go out on a path of its own.
The white paper says China's development in its interactions with the world has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China's path is in line with China's national conditions and adapted to the demands of the times.
China safeguards world peace through practical actions.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any wars or conflicts, nor has it taken an inch of land from any other country.
The White Paper points out that the fundamental reason for the great success of China's development over the past 70 years is that it has found the correct path of development with Chinese characteristics and has steadfastly followed it.
This is the way to establish, put the interests of the people first, reform and innovate, seek common development in openness and rule the country in an all-round way according to law, based on the national conditions of the country.
China is enormous in size, complex in national conditions and difficult to govern.Without a united and strong leadership, China will be divided and disintegrated, bringing disaster to the world.
'For 70 years, China has defeated all kinds of risks and challenges, creating one Chinese miracle after another that has captured the world's attention,' the white paper said.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in particular, historic achievements and changes have taken place in China's development.The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up and becoming rich to becoming strong, and is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation than at any other time in history.
This development path of China will show more and more bright prospects with the advance of the times.

New Regulation Seeks Comments on Qualifications for Social Capital to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
Acquiring Rural Land Management Right with Social Capital requires Qualifications
"Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right" for public consultation It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to acquire land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published on its website a notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right (Amendment Draft) (hereinafter referred to as the Opinion Draft), which increases the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to acquire land management right.
The Draft Opinion is now open to the community for comment.
To implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of "three-power separation," the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Measures for the Management of the Transfer of the Right to Operate Rural Land Contracting, forming the Opinion Draft, the ministry said.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters learned that the first published "opinion draft" has many important revisions.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting defines the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of "the separation of three powers", sets up separate sections on "land contracting and management rights" and "land management rights," and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, swap and transfer of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, stock-taking or other forms).
In order to implement the concept of "three powers divided" and effectively respond to the tenor of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and to take into account the differences in the parties, procedures and supervision between the transfer of land management rights and the swap and transfer of land management rights, the draft revision defines the scope of the transfer, focuses on the transfer of land management rights, including leasing and stock ownership, and changes the name of the Regulation from the Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights to the Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights.
For the transfer and swap of land contract management rights, the administrative measures will be formulated separately.
The Opinion notes that in the context of "three powers divided," farmers are only entitled to land management for a certain period of time.
Theoretically speaking, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers only have the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is no longer legally necessary to stipulate the return of the contracted land to the original contractor, and it is in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent farmers from losing their land, priority shares, lease first, buy back and other methods have been developed in practice.
Considering that the theory of preferred shares has been maturely discussed in the company law, it is suggested to take it as an advocacy provision to guard against the risk of losing the land.
