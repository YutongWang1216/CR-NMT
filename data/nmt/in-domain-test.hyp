Women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of time!
China faced Dutch women's volleyball on Wednesday, winning nine straight victories after being knocked back into the city by an opponent after winning two games in a row.
The World Cup is nearing its end, and despite the prospect of defending the title, China's women's volleyball team can't be taken lightly against Serbia.
In the first two sets of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever, starting with 25:19, 25:16, until the third inning, when the team had a setback.
The Dutch women's volleyball team stepped up its offensive service after falling behind, hitting the Chinese team's passing, and the girls' aggressiveness began to increase the number of errors that eventually led them back to the city at 21:25.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the match: "The third inning, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points."
Of course, the Dutch women's volleyball ability should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball game also prepared for difficulties, although losing a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's hands. "It's normal to win and lose games against the strong teams and it's normal to play five games, so we told the players to pay attention," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the situation, Zhang Changning in the offensive end firepower open, the single game scored 8 points, for the team to win the great success.
So far, only two rounds remain in the 11 rounds of the match, and although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, it is a real wake-up call for the Chinese women's volleyball team against the Netherlands: the more crucial the moment, the more they must do their best.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams filled five innings and the US were unable to take three points from their opponents, allowing the Chinese women's volleyball team to defend their titles one round ahead of time by scoring all three points against Serbia.
All sorts of things are moving in the direction of a favorable situation for Chinese women's volleyball.
However, despite the absence of all six of Serbia's major players, it does not mean they will easily send three points to China.
In the form of the table, Serbia has largely lost the medal, which means they can "lighten up" against the Chinese women's volleyball team, leaving the baggage behind and striking their opponents.
Also, the Serbian substitute is not a "slayer-by-catcher" lamb either. The thickness of the Dutch squad was demonstrated by the fact that the Serbian side reversed the Dutch main squad 3-2 in five games of the previous match against the Netherlands.
"Before the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that neither Holland nor Seychelles could handle it: "Osaka is going to be a very difficult game.
Now that the trumpet of defending the crown has been blown, the game has really entered the stage of white-hot.
On the strength lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above its opponents, but at the last critical moment, it depends on whether the women's volleyball team will be able to play their normal level and release themselves on the field.

But times are changing, he said.
"We are experiencing increasingly intense competition," said Stoltenberg.

More than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Tangzhou Star cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who took part in the event boarded the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a crippled person who rarely goes out because of the inconvenience of moving his feet.
He said: "Today, for the first time in a cruise, I enjoy the magnificent waves of the Xiangjiang River and the pulse of Changsha's development.
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Worker Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha provided meticulous service to the disabled.
Particularly for those with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carry them on their backs up and down the cruise ship.
Over the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the government, the cause of the disabled in Changsha has been developing and improving.More and more disabled people have truly become participants, contributors and enjoyers of social and economic development.
... span class='class1'>Republics are approaching their seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media are flashing with images we don't remember at all - they bring heat and light to our shining days.
However, if the hero walks alongside, also looks as ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, devoted himself to the study of rice and the cultivation of good seeds to cultivate the whole world, so that billions of people in China would no longer feel hungry and discouraged. He was usually like an old peasant who liked to walk on the fields.
They, benevolence, simplicity, and perseverance, are easy to be cheerful in the business of outsiders and their broomsticks are dear to them, without regard for the traces of fame or wealth or splendor.
Just as in Jin Yong's novels, Shaolin Temple collects the sweeping monk, although he embraces the worldly martial arts, not boastful, not happy or sad.
Every "sweep monk" , every pair of naked sons, has a homeland behind me.
The nation bears, not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of billions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl high school student's words, was crazy by netizens, "When a hero passes by, someone sits by the side of the road and applauds ...
In fact, when the hero and the hero applause, there is no contradiction.
Those who clap by the side of the road are also transmitting heat and light, and they themselves are luminous bodies.
Ordinary as you are like me, there is always some chance in life, there are moments, there is a cumulative, but also the shape of heroes.
Zou Bihua, a prominent judge in Shanghai, shouldered the responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting he let the master of the communication room on stage to tell his story and sent countless newspaper letters every year, never making mistakes.
It's the little pity between the heroes. One hero is clapping the hands of another.
Sweeping monks have the Shaolin Temple Tibetan sutra pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast field of rice experiments, Nanrendong has the "sky eye", Qin Yi has the stage, Zhou Ruchang has the pulpit ... whether to become a hero, not only depends on their own efforts, but also needs better environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "China's Eye of Heaven" is a myth now.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still climbing the slope, and the novelist, Liu Tzu-xin, had not yet started to write "Three Bodies" .
At that time, the most cattle's "eye" was the one-sided radio telescope, Arecibo, in the valley of the island of Puerto Rico, which was 350 metres in diameter and considered the most insurmountable in the world.
At that time, the diameter of the Chinese radio telescope, less than one tenth of the people.
But Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research and salary in Japan, insists on returning home with a near-crazy idea of building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more information from outer space!
China's a hundred wastes to be entertained, investing huge sums of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted the Southeast, and the "Eye of Heaven" project was launched in full swing.
It took 12 years to locate and nine years to complete.
The 500-metre "eye of the sky" opens and China has made "the world's unique big scientific project" without precedent.
Thus, the Eye of Heaven is great, the Southeast is great, the Republic is big, standing high in the distance is great.
With the trust of the country, the goodwill of the people, Southeast people have the opportunity to become the soul of the nation's liver.
There are young talented, gray-haired heroes go by nicely, there are people in the roadside gently applause, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.
Waste classification education first into the Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll captured
Children were taught to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage in a kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin, on the 27th.
It is reported that this is the first time garbage classification into the local preschool education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Work Program for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in Jilin Province".
On the basis of the pilot study on the mandatory classification of domestic waste in Changchun in 2005, the province decided to carry out the classification of domestic waste in local cities.
Jilin is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, to achieve a child-driven family, kindergarten-driven society's effect, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Hi Faner International Kindergarten Executive Director Liu Lijuan said.
On the same day, the gardener read the Environmental Initiative, hoping to classify the rubbish from the children.
After performing the dance of "Low Carbon Pui Pui" , the children grouped together to play a small game of sorting rubbish.
Instructors also issued "recyclable" "other trash" labels, advising children to stick labels to trash cans and videotape them on their way home.
Liu Lijuan introduced, the kindergarten has been advocating the concept of low-carbon, green environmental protection, the regular opening of environmental lecture halls.
A sortable garbage can has also been set up in the garden's garbage drop-in area, and the drop-in category is marked on it.
The teacher taught the children what to do with recyclable rubbish.
Preliminary statistics show that by 2018 in Jilin Province, about 5.5652 million tons of municipal solid waste were produced, all of which went to the domestic waste disposal site for disposal.
Among them, 32.29 million tons of sanitary landfills were incinerated and 29.23 million tons were treated with a comprehensive utilization process.
After years of hard work, the province's cities and counties have the capacity to treat domestic waste harmlessly.
The Jilin Provincial Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Municipal Waste in Jilin Province, which has been issued, clearly calls for in-depth activities such as classifying waste into schools, teaching materials and classrooms, and for enhancing the interaction between students and parents through the creation of garbage classification songs, ballads, cartoons and micro-videos, so as to achieve the effect of "educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community and fostering a new generation".

Chirac's death remains a political legacy
On the 26th, French President Chirac passed away at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in the midst of an unprecedented upheaval in a century, the French politician's many political legacies during his reign still deserve our praise.
Chirac was President of France for 12 years in a very charismatic way.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of De Gaulleism and firmly supported European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European dream" .
At the same time, he vigorously advocated the world multipolarization and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of the statesman.
That is why the French press has described him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's most remarkable political decisions was his opposition to the U. S. -led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany in the forefront of the anti-war struggle against American pressure.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an escalation of terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Subsequently, Chirac's warning proved to be correct.
At a time when European integration is at a standstill and U.S. unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Mr. Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly very enlightening.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and kind.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the golden decade of Sino-French relations.After his first election to the presidency in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations from the strategic perspective of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between the two countries have entered a completely new stage.
During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and bilateral cooperation in aviation, nuclear power and railway transportation made breakthrough progress.
The Sino-French Culture Year, initiated by Chirac, created a completely new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong devotion to Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats introduced, Chirac can recite some of Li Bai, Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
"Not looking at the pyramids is not really going to Egypt, not looking at the terra cotta figures is not really going to China" - from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "Western concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and its political position in the world.
But I have full confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization and its experience is sufficient to help it build the concepts and values for harmonious development and to assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creativity to world culture and enrich world culture.
The ancestors are gone, but Chirac's political legacy and revelations to the world will endure.

HKSAR Legislative Council Established Members' Joint Office Against U.S. Involvement Act
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) issued a joint statement on the 27th, the U.S. Senate and Senate foreign committees to pass the "Hong Kong Bill of Human Rights and Democracy" strongly opposed.
The statement, signed by the 40-member Joint Office of the 40 Constituent Members, said Hong Kong currently enjoys rights under the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in various economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports and other fields in the name of "Hong Kong, China".
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always adhered strictly to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in various areas of co-operation.
The statement said there was no need for the U.S. Senate and Senate Foreign Committees to pass the bill, but only in response to the call from their harmful agent as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political chips for their agent in Hong Kong.
The founding MPs expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of the US trade surplus, the statement said.
The rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make Hong Kong a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the U.S. passes the bill, it will not only discourage the interests of Hong Kong and the U.S. itself, but will also further aggravate China-U.S. relations.
The statement said that Hong Kong would unswervingly and consistently implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy the rights conferred on it by the Basic Law and fulfill its obligations in real earnest.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international business in the past, present and future.
Both houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week, the European Times reported.
France's President Jacques MacKinnon said in a recent statement that France could not "admit all" but was trying to "admit them properly".
The report says Mr. Maclone is trying to find a middle ground in immigration to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In an interview during the general debate in the United States General Assembly in New York recently, Mr. Maclone said he hoped there would be a genuine "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"If France wishes to be able to accept [immigrants] properly, it cannot accept all people," he said.
The four focuses of the immigration policy were outlined: the granting of asylum status to refugees in need of protection; a more efficient promotion of immigration integration; the reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and a more efficient resettlement of persons who entered France illegally and were not desirable to remain in France.
The question of whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "national medical aid" (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion before.
Mr Maclone said he wanted to be able to “evaluate” the system, but instead of abolishing it, he wanted it to be limited.
After his remarks, the far-right leader of the National Union of Nationalities, Le Penfayne, called his gesture "nonsense" .
The right-wing Republican, Senate Speaker Angela Merkel, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "face-to-face" way, indirectly criticizing Mr Maclone.
Left-wing Socialist lawmaker Jean-Claude Waugh believes France should "be more receptive and better" on immigration and criticizes him for "manning" the issue.
The new asylum and immigration law, enacted a year ago, has divided views within the ruling party but failed to placate the right-wing opposition, the report said.
In the next 2022 election, the issue of immigration policy will again be the centre of attack on the far right, and Mr. Maclone needs to do something about it, but risks infuriating left-wingers within the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly is reported to be debating immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are in the grip of a "repurchase spree", with many listed companies offering "real gold and silver" to buy back their shares.
As at 27, the total amount of repurchase funds implemented by listed A-share companies in Hong Kong has exceeded Rmb100bn (about the same amount) in 2008, a record high for the amount of repurchase funds in A-shares, according to financial data service Oriental Wealth.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Rong Information Co., Ltd., said the low valuation of the A-share market as a whole this year and the relatively low price repurchase of shares were conducive to improving the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, reflecting the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market value and the abundant cash flow situation, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules on the implementation of share repurchase rules for listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for the repurchase of shares.
According to media statistics, listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan are mainly in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics equipment manufacturing industries.
In addition, from the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
At the top of the list were Yili shares, with a buy-back of more than $5 billion.
What will be the effect of the repurchase of shares on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Finance of the People's University of China, told China-Presse that the repurchase shows that listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial position, have the ability to maintain price stability and give investor confidence, and that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, responsible to the market and responsible to investors.
The former is based on the good performance of the company while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the most central element of the foundation.
The stock repurchase of listed companies is beneficial to boost investor confidence and support the stock price of listed companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, based on the expected number of repurchase of A-share listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, as well as the average transaction price of repurchase shares, the repurchase of A-shares is expected to bring more than 150 billion yuan in incremental funds to the A-share market this year.
In the past two months, the restoration of the large-scale mural "Tianhou Temple" in Tianjin, China's key cultural security unit, was concluded on the 26th and will reopen to the public during this year's National Day.
"The Divine Landmark of Heavenly Queen" is a large-scale traditional mural which reflects the life of Mazu.
With the approval of the relevant state departments, Cai Changkui, former director of Tianjin Museum of Civil Customs (Tianhou Palace), was drawn from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that the mural was painted on the southern and northern walls of the palace, 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high, with more than 30 stories, including the birth of the day, the sea ride, and the feathered rise of the sky.
In recent years, rainy summers and dry winters in Tianjin have led to the rupture of the murals, which accounted for 60 percent of the total area, Cai said.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the ancestors, the Ancient Culture Street Commission of Nankai District, Tianjin City and Tianhou Palace have started the restoration of the palace hall and the inner wall paintings.
The restoration work was led by Cai Changkui and four famous Chinese painters were invited to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of "repairing old and old" , and the original murals have been adjusted to local contents, supplementing the original imperfection.
In the restoration, we also made innovations and experiments in color, materials, ink and so on.
After the restoration, the original murals were preserved in style, spirit, spirit and art.
Built in 1326, the imperial palace, also known as the imperial palace, has undergone many renovations. It is the oldest building complex in Tianjin and one of the oldest ancestor temples in China.
On September 25, the launch ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport was solemnly held.
The modeling of the Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal Building, which means "Phoenix spreads its wings", is regarded as the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
The Beijing Capital International Airport is now overloaded, carrying 100 million plus passengers last year, making it the world's second-largest airport to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers and 20 percent of international flights by 2022, and 72 million passengers and 30 percent of international flights by 2025.
As a new kingdom, how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City of Hebei Province.
Its terminal's rooftop steel frame has a surface projection area of 180,000 square metres and is the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first two terminals with two arrival levels and two departure levels - the F1-F4 is the international arrival, the domestic arrival, the domestic departure and the international departure.
The terminal building is connected to the highway and the double-decker bridge of the airport, which corresponds to the departure level of the terminal buildings F3 and F4-F4, respectively. Both levels of domestic departure are acceptable.
Beijing Daxing International Airport's first flight opened the Beijing "double airport" era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new power source for the development of the state and a comprehensive regional transport hub supporting the construction of the Xiong'an New Area. So far, 66 airlines are interested in entering the Beijing Daxing International Airport, of which 20 are domestic, 46 are Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and foreign airlines.
In the winter and spring season of 2008, the Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international routes.
This forms a "double hub" airport pattern with harmonious development, moderate competition and international first-class competitiveness with Beijing Capital International Airport, which not only relieves the operational pressure of the capacity saturation of the capital airport, but also better meets the urgent needs of the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and its surrounding areas and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport fully considers the geographical location, the relationship between the airport and its surrounding airspace and operational environment.For the first time in China, the airport runway has adopted the "all-way" layout, adopted the world's largest air traffic control automation system, and established China's largest terminal control area, thus maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, domestic airports of this size have adopted a localized baggage automatic processing and information management system, and adopted an innovative baggage transmission mode to enhance the efficiency of baggage handling system.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, the first flight, a harbinger of the phoenix wing show off cool takeoff.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts and has a localization rate of 98 percent or more, will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in its surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
Ma Hua Provisional Meeting in November to Lower Party Age to 16
Ma tentatively convened a central congress in early November to revise the Party Constitution to reduce the age of Party membership to 16.
As Congress lowered the voting age for the general election, Mr. Ma announced that he would convene this year's 66th Central Congress to propose amendments to the party's constitution, including a reduction in Mr. Ma's membership age from the current 18-year-old to 16.
Mr. Nasri Wei, president of the Malaysian General Assembly, said the date of the Central Committee was scheduled to be changed on November 2 and 3 this year due to the by-election of the Council seat in Dannibe.
He said that as the Election Committee would not meet until October 1 to finalize the date of by-election nominations and voting days for the seats in Than Shweei, they would meet the following day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that yesterday's meeting of the CPC aimed at finalizing the date of the congress and amending the Constitution of the Party had only happened to coincide with the untimely death of Aboriginal Solidarity Congressman Nabil Mohamphali, who had joined the by-election agenda for the country.
Wang Boxiang, secretary of Shandong Yuanshouguang County Committee - Qiangxian Fumin Chizixin - Xinhua Net
Wang Boxiang, born in February 1943 in Shouguang, Shandong province, took part in the work in 1967 and served successively as secretary of township and township Party committees, secretary of county committees and mayor.
In 1986, Wang was appointed secretary of Shouguang County Committee in Shandong Province, where Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five years in office, Mr. Wang focused on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing the salt-alkali beaches in the north of Shoushu; and laying the groundwork for industrial overturning so that the Shousheng people could gather their pockets and straighten their backs.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, there are also lessons from growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a bumper harvest of vegetables, but they could not sell them and were rotten in the fields.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasping vegetables is to do a good job in circulation.
Shouguang set up the vegetable wholesale market first and opened the prelude to the development of the market economy.
Party cadres should take the lead and screw up, and bear all the losses in the county.
In 1989, with Wang's support, 17 party members, including Wang Leyi of Zhucun, in Sanyuan, set up 17 winter-warm vegetable shed, in which 17 "double-thousand-yuan households" emerged.
Subsequently, a promotion team was set up in the county, and under the mobilization of Wang, Wang Leyi toured the towns and villages to guide him. In his first year, he promoted more than 5,000 vegetable canopies, which later spread to the county and even to the whole country.
For hundreds of years, the 1.6 million mu of land in Shoushoubei was painted on shallow beaches in addition to salt-alkali beaches.
The life of the local people is very difficult.
Shou Nan has vegetable canopy, how does Shou Bei do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to go to war and camp on the waste alkaline beach for forty or fifty days.
At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and developed a "quake basin" on the salt-alkali beaches.
In July 1986, Wang attended Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as the secretary of the county council.
During the meeting, a comparative table of industrial economic figures in the twelve counties of Weifang City was issued.At first glance, the total industrial output value was good, and Shouguang ranked fourth.
But if raw salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output is worth only $119 million, ranking third to the bottom.
Wang Boxiang, with a delegation of more than 70 people, went to the field to "change his mind" .
Less than a year after returning, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, the Mission was organized to take sutras from Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang lacks enterprises, and even less entrepreneurs.
Wang presided over the holding of a special conference slate: in the county's open selection of factory managers, 40 "enterprising people" stand out, was pushed to the front line of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang deputy mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 vegetable canoes, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4,4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 households, and a contingent of cadres recognized by the general public, who still affectionately call him "Our Birth Clerks".
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of Foreign Ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ce d'Ivoire, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Mr. Pandor, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger, Mr. Kara, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, etc. attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, uniting forces.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is undermined and the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including those in Africa, are jeopardized.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to join hands, shoulder to shoulder, and unity can be strengthened.
In the Security Council, three African countries speak in one voice, focusing not only on three votes, but on the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just by four votes, but by leading other countries to follow up, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
China and the African members of the Security Council have established the "3+1" coordination mechanism since the beginning of the year.
Second, settle disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated a political settlement of hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, in particular African hot spots, are mostly the scourges of colonialism, while others are directly related to external factors.
Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Third, self-improvement through self-reliance.
African countries and peoples are most aware of Africa's problems, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing hot issues in Africa, the Council should focus on listening and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and resolutely promote capacity-building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, governance through development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are both developing countries. We must put economic and social development first and support each other's development path of their choice.
China is ready to co-operate with the African Union Agenda 2063, the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development by 2030 and the development strategies of African countries in closely linking them, so as to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in African development.
The outbreak of the Ebola outbreak has reoccurred in the Congo, and China has and will continue to extend its full support, providing human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate its actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other organizations to intensify their assistance so as to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo.

Wuhan to Promote the Intellectualized Transformation of Industrial Enterprises
According to a series of press conferences held by the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office on the 27th, the city has accelerated its industrial intelligence transformation and implemented transformational subsidies of up to 20 million yuan this year.
So far, more than 800 industrial enterprises above the scale of the intellectualized transformation needs of information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of Wuhan's Bureau of Economics and Informatization, said that from this year, Wuhan had launched an action plan for the intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises to provide free consultation and diagnosis services and solutions for industrial enterprises above the scale of demand, so as to promote the new round of high-level enterprises' technological transformation in an all-round way.
According to the plan, Wuhan openly selects a number of specialized diagnostic service institutions each year to conduct an intellectualized needs survey for all industrial enterprises above the scale of the city by setting up columns, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door reporting.
So far, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have been collected on the intellectualized transformation needs of information, accounting for more than one-third of the city's industrial enterprises.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter the enterprises in batches to conduct "one-on-one" on-the-spot evaluation and program demonstration.
At present, the city is organizing 373 intellectualized reconstruction projects, with a total investment of 29.76 billion yuan.The first intellectualized production line in Hongxin Communications China, the first national intellectualized production line in Hongxinhua, the leading intellectualized mobile phone production line in Motorola, the first digitalized unmanned mobile phone production line in Wuhan Siemens transformer, the first batch of satellite production line in space science, the intellectualized production line in Huisheng biology world, the intelligent production line of new veterinary drugs and the smart home of Internet of Things in Europe have been launched one after another.

At the same time, financial institutions such as Zhejiang Commercial Bank and Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch have been actively engaged in providing personalized financial services for the intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises, thus greatly alleviating the pressure of enterprise financing.
Trudo's "people collapsed" . Can he succeed in re-election
This time, he tripped his way out of a big crater, which he had dug by himself.
Canadian media have revealed images of the current prime minister, Trudo, posing as black in recent days.
It was seen as an apparent act of racial discrimination that caused a stir in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, do not buy much.
Trudo lifted a stone and threw it on his own feet.
As political commentators such as Lee Lee have pointed out, since the rise of the anti-black-faced movement from the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile critics of opposition parties or dissidents within their own party for "significant losses" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits this mistake should be dismissed immediately".
To put it simply, it was Trudo himself who made this big hole that tripped him up.
The son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, he was young and handsome, and had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first set out.
He, a former political vegetarian, took over as head of the Federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly good fight in Canada's federal legislative elections in 2015 when the Liberals won valuable separate cabinet seats in the lower house of the Union.
At that time, Trudo put forward many enabling policies and concepts, such as "ethnic and gender equality" "ecological environmental protection" "economic revitalization", and stressed the eradication of corruption and "bad practices".
For five years in office, however, he has been "high and low" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
Regardless of the issue of ethnic and gender equality, the "black-faced" incident follows a series of "nonsense" attempts to get aboriginal groups and leaders to move protest tents to the Capitol Hill gates on Canada's 150th anniversary.
In the fight against corruption, Trudo was caught up in the raging "Landone affair" earlier this year.
It was revealed that the construction company in his hometown, "Lan Wanling" major irregularities for personal gains and abuses, to the departments and officials responsible for the investigation and punishment of the latter "high-handed.
Furthermore, Trudo's rage at revealing abuses after the ruckus - as mentioned earlier - was the first Canadian prosecutor-general to reveal the cases directly.
Although the case itself has some doubts, its suspicion is hard to clear.
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudo's five-year rule was largely the result of his own "digging hole" , and that the biggest "digging holes" were the three "killing their own nests" and "being more lenient and strict with the law.
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, respondents in favor of Trudo have slid from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent since 2015, while opponents have soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Even a sizeable number of voters who are still willing to vote for the FNL, though other opposition parties and their leaders are equally underperforming, now disapprove of the prime minister and ruling party leader.
On October 21st, the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin. Can Trudo repeat a dramatic victory over five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened to traffic.
Xinjing News reporters from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission learned that the capital airport is in a state of supersaturation operation, Daxing International Airport opened, will enhance the capacity of the capital's aviation services.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city with two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation and Pudong Airport is mainly engaged in international shipping.
Daxing airport air services, from the perspective of business development, for the capital airport is more positive impact.
Capital Airport, which handles more than 100 million passengers in 2018, ranks first in the country, but still suffers from a significant weakness in capacity compared with the rapidly growing demand for business, especially for international airlines.
In order to better serve the needs of passengers at home and abroad for tourism and business trips, and in line with the trend of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally integrated cities, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large-scale international hub airport, with a plan to meet annual passenger throughput of 100 million and cargo throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.
From an economic accounting point of view, Daxing International Airport's traffic will obviously have a win-win effect, ease the tension in Beijing's air transport capacity, speed up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput and create an incremental cake for the capital's dual-nuclear operations.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to concentrate on traveling at the capital airport in the future, but also to reduce a series of problems arising from the over-concentration of routes, such as the longer safeguard time at the terminal, the slower boarding speed of passengers, the indirect increase in the detention time of aircraft and passengers at the airport, the greater burden on airport operations, and the reduction of passenger travel through the capital airport.
According to media calculations on the time and cost of various transportation routes to the major international airports, such as the Beijing-Kaizhou Expressway, which starts from the southern rings and goes directly to Daxing Airport, can be driven for 50 minutes, with a round trip of about 40 yuan and a round trip of 15 yuan, while the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line is chosen for a distance of 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan.
Generally speaking, there are many kinds of transportation options for the public to go to Tai Hing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development: Daxing airport is located in the transportation hub of Beijing and Tianjin, so it is a little far away from Beijing, but it has intensified the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, which makes it easier for more people to travel and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the transportation planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport's supporting transport facilities are very perfect, in addition to Beijing District direct Daxing Airport Airport Line, there are many expressway connection Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.
Just as passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangdong-Guangdong Expressway, Guangdong-Shenzhen Expressway, residents of Langfang, Xiong'an New Area and other places around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport to obtain convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that the opening of Daxing International Airport has not only added a few runways and a few aircraft, but also has far-reaching influence and positive significance from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration.It is not only related to the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also provides diversified choices for the travel of the vast number of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, and promotes the further improvement of the service quality of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei shipping industry.
Therefore, for Daxing airport traffic, we should not only calculate the economic small accounts, but also calculate the overall development of large accounts.

Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum held in Cheng Tianshun province
Ruan Dejian, deputy director of Vietnam's parliamentary economic committee, revealed that early this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new upturns and continued to grow.
The forum focused on economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of population population planning and proposed measures for economic and social development in late population planning and 2020.
At the Forum, participants exchanged views and views on four topics, namely, economic development and the impact of some of the FTAs, some prominent issues in Vietnam's economy, prominent issues in Vietnam's socio-cultural aspects in population, and projections and recommendations on Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Representatives generally believed that global economic growth was slowing and risks and challenges were increasing in the first few months of the year.
Trade frictions among major economies have further constrained global trade and investment.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the stagnation of 70 per cent of the world's economies, the International Monetary Fund has concluded that Vietnam's economy has achieved many encouraging results, with macroeconomic stability and effective control of inflation, with the average consumer price index (CPI) growing by 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2008, the lowest growth rate in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2007, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period in the same period last year.
In making a prediction of Vietnam's economic development trend in Hong Kong through 2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said Vietnam's economy had shown a high momentum of growth in the face of global economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic situation will remain basically stable, the implementation of the free trade agreements will facilitate trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement will be further strengthened, and Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend due to trade frictions.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the mechanism of early warning and monitoring, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, seek opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of agricultural and aquatic products and other commodities.
At the same time, keeping inflation at a reasonable level is a way of promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consulate General's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the past 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more to improving global economic governance and promoting common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's livelihood.
As the world's second-largest economy, China has contributed more than 30 percent to world economic growth, especially the China-China Initiative, which has seen deepening cooperation between local provinces and municipalities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the Territories, Liu said.
He said this year marks the opening of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 61 years, and the two countries enjoy fraternal friendship, where mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force for the economic and social development of the region.
The governor of Siem Reap Province, Dishahar, highly praised the great achievements of New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
Disayha looks forward to continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
He said the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap Province and Chinese provinces and municipalities are striking.So far, friendly relations have been established with 28 Chinese provinces and municipalities, large-scale cultural and entertainment projects such as Angkor Smile and the landing of the Angkor Dynasty, Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, Siem Reap New International Airport Project, special training courses for officials of the Siem Reap Provincial Government, scholarships for studying in Siam, village free clinics, renovation of urban roads and reconstruction of cataract, etc.
State Secretary of the Cambodian Ministry of Defence Ken Wensong, Chairman of the Council of Siem Reap Province, Governor of the 5th Provincial Region, Cambodia Council of Siem Reap Branch, Volunteers Teachers, Cambodian Chinese Chamber of Commerce Siem Reap Branch, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign delegations to Siem Reap were present at the reception.
Witnessing Digital China's 10 Years of Cloud Rising in Cloudy Towns - Xinhua
If the 2009 local website forum were to be taken as its starting point, it would have been a full decade since its 25-27th meeting in Hangzhou.
From the concept of cloud fog to the practice of clouds, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that underpin China's economic development, social management and public services in a decade.
At the Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic cell workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, a number of new "colleagues" loaded with artificial intelligence for Aliyun have recently been around quality inspectors.
It is 24 hours unremitting, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manpower, the accuracy of quality inspection is more than 95%.
The camera-mounted “quality inspector” has focused on more than 40,000 samples of flaws that can be quickly converted from infrared images into binary language and classified into faulty batteries by the cloud computing power behind them, according to company officials.
The company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-assisted manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued the "Guidelines for Promoting the Implementation of Clouds in Enterprises" by 2018-2012, which states that by 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will strive to achieve a marked increase in enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm of clouds and a marked increase in the proportion and application depth of clouds.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for the digital economy, which is a key element of data, says Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun.
At the same time, over the past decade, the scale of our cloud computing industry has been expanding.
The white paper on cloud computing development, released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, shows that China's overall market for cloud computing in 2018 amounts to 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's conference in Yunqi, the "urban brain" , which debuted three years in a row, is still a cause for concern.
Mr Ali said the city's brain had moved from a vehicle to a city management hub, with its co-operative application expanding to 23 cities around the world.
With camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms have enabled the urban brain to implement new urban management services, such as "stop first and pay later", "recognize the number of visitors in real time" and "tourism route design".
In the field of government services, cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government services by joining one cloud to do one thing and pushing one thing at a time.
At present, Zhejiang has constructed the province's unified public data platform through government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform already covers more than 57 million people living in the province and more than 15 million legal entities, with 3,066 categories of 19.80 billion data.
Zhejiang government departments have averaged 12 million calls and shares of data each month, and every time the data flows over the cloud, it could mean that people are less likely to run errands.
Be careful about making tea in plastic tea bags!
A new Canadian study has found that a bag of plastic tea can release billions or even billions of particles of plastic, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of micro-plastics, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Soaking plastic tea bags in a cup of almost boiling water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion particles of plastic and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles of plastic into the cup, researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reported.
This is significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of micro-plastics.
According to research published earlier in 2008, the average person eats at least 50,000 particles of plastic a year and inhales the same amount of micro-plastics.
The researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and coffee shops, opened them, washed them and immersed them in almost boiling water for five minutes before analyzing them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion particles of plastic, "a number of orders above the plastic load of other foodstuffs".
Most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands of tea bags made from natural fibre still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some branded tea bags, which were tested by researchers, were no longer made of paper but of plastic.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, which the researchers defined as being between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size and are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest sewers around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered particles of plastic in human waste samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team put water fleas into polluted water and found that micro-plastics can affect the behaviour of the water fleas and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization, there is so far no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO said more research was needed to understand how the plastics spread to the environment and what impact it had on humans.
The researchers speculated that the tea bags released large amounts of plastic particles, possibly because they were in contact with boiling water and could break down or exude toxic substances even when “food grade” plastic was heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster will erode the fruits of a generation's development.
The disasters in Baghdad, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes this year, illustrate this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their societies and lifestyles and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At Monday's climate action summit, small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction, working together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States contributed little to global warming, they paid the highest price.
Given their middle-income status, many of these countries are also caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to take major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance to small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-adaptive infrastructure and ways of transition to renewable energy, and urged international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly the heavily indebted middle-income countries, gain access to finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The new special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the " sweeping" aftermath of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may experience some extreme sea level rise that would have occurred only once a century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investments in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living coral, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face the high costs of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets to keep them afloat by price fluctuations.
Efforts are also under way in some countries to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere," Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Agenda for the Sustainable Development of 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples from which the world can draw.
He emphasized that small island developing States were special cases of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's economy is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption, as the financial system is now liquid, Finance Minister Mittal Sitaraman said on Thursday.
Mr. Sitaraman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Tsvangirai did not say what the remarks were aimed at.
Some Indian and overseas media have blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for India's slowing economy.
Citing the decline in auto sales as an example, Mr. Xitaraman denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline.
The decline in auto sales was largely due to cyclical factors, he said.
India's economy is likely to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending, Mr. Sitaraman predicts.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and lasts until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice, the province's primary and secondary schools during the National Day holidays in violation of remedial courses, and organized personnel to conduct random reconnaissance visits.

Sui Loyalty requirements from six aspects of pig production measures to implement.
Catch the "vegetable basket" of the mayor responsible for the implementation of the system, this year the province's clear 45 million pigs out of the castle task has been decomposed into the city-states, into the accountability system assessment.
We will do a good job in implementing various policies and measures, and effectively solve the problem of "last kilometer" in implementing policies.
We will ensure the production and implementation of sows for breeding, earnestly implement the policy of subsidizing the breeding of sows for good breeding, encourage breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of sows and select, in a planned way, excellent sows from commercial pig populations.
We should do a good job of attracting investment and take the famous domestic large-scale aquaculture enterprises that have not entered our province as the most important part of attracting investment.
We will do a good job in implementing the market circulation system, speeding up the construction of raw pig cold chain logistics facilities and promoting the transition from "pigs" to "meat transfer".
The modern epidemic prevention system should be implemented well, and all localities should be equipped with grassroots quarantine personnel corresponding to the scale and tasks of breeding, so as to establish the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Loyalty demands that all efforts be made to safeguard the supply of meat markets, ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and wide-ranging supply cuts, and ensure a steady supply of pork markets for major holidays.
The meeting also carried out deployments on the prevention and control of swine fever in Africa, the arrest and arrest of important waters in the Yangtze River basin in our province and the acquisition of mid-late rice in the province.
The old name of Shanghai, such as the Great White Rabbit, represents the Party class for college students

Abe also spoke Chinese on the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on videotape.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, everyone. I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I wish to extend, on behalf of the Japanese Government and people, warm congratulations.
At the G20 summit in Osaka in June, Japan and China expressed the firm will of the G20 to the world through the Declaration of the G20 Leaders in Osaka.

鈥淚n some construction sites, over-aged migrant workers are estimated to make up more than half.鈥?
Where can I find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many 'old people' on the construction site.
Recently, there are a lot of over-age migrant workers on the construction site (over retirement age) phenomenon, in the construction industry for years to do engineering contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities carry out the rain and sewage diversion project, there are a lot of migrant workers on the campus, if you look carefully, you will find that there are many over-aged migrant workers.
Over-aged migrant workers go out to work not because they cannot afford to be idle, but because they can't afford to be idle, because the helplessness and hardship of having to do so - whether they save money to solve their old age and medical problems or help their children - drive these supposedly idle old people to continue to work hard.
The "old dependent" of over-aged migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, reading books, helping children build houses, buying cars, helping children to start a family, and raising grandchildren from generation to generation, when these migrant workers have fulfilled their "life's tasks", their pockets have been emptied and even a lot of debts have been incurred, and most of them lack the accumulation of wealth.
In order not to drag their children and accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do it".
The reluctance of many "post-1980" and even "post-1990" and even "00" new generations of migrant workers to engage in hard-working, highly labour-intensive secondary or low-end service industries has created a structural "employment shortage" that provides opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of expertise and the decline in physical functioning and labour capacity, many over-aged migrant workers are engaged in jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and low security.
The plight of over-aged migrant workers behind "no idleness" cannot be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of wage arrears and wage-paying, to improve labor protection, to reduce safety risks, to increase labor income and to improve the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers, in addition to their "self-saving" , they are equally inseparable from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-aged migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their old-age and medical problems, and they must find other ways to support their families.
To understand the "cannot idle" helplessness and strongness of over-aged migrant workers helps us better understand the love and pain of over-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and finding ways to get them back to the countryside to truly achieve "old-age dependency", demanding that the public sector, the market and society should share responsibilities and work together in a constructive interaction.
Mr. Chemetzov said that Russia would not export the system for the next five years because "it would have to supply its own troops before it could export production".
This is in full conformity with international practice.
Leading producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence requirements first before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grethov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, said the system was near completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Compaqian.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that use the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles that can intercept missiles with a range of 3,500 kilometers or less.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in close space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, particularly the S-400 system, which is important from a defence standpoint.
Sergei Chemetzov has expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is now in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 Air Defense System is in the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to information on September 15, the Arctic Air Defense Corps of New Isle (NAA) has completed the modification of its S-400 air defense missile system.
This is not Russian militarization in the Arctic.
The defence ministry said it was all part of a transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has significantly increased," the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service said.
It is important that, according to military assessments, the system is used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air defence regiment officers and soldiers have trained for the new system and are ready to enter combat duty.
It was equipped with a S-300 long-range air defence system and still has some of it.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they targets at high speeds in the outer layers or "fish that leak out of the net" near protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the diamond-Atai Airborne Defence Covent, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometers per second at 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defences in the Arctic to ensure the safety of its airspace over the northern sea routes.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor (M2DT) anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air-defence battalion to strengthen the air-defence system in the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at that time that the Arctic "Thor" troops will be expanded in the future to a complete brigade-level system.
Together with the newly deployed S-400 systems on the New Isles and the Koala Peninsula and the short-range systems of the Panzer-SA deployed in the Arctic, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful defence of the Russian polar sky.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will have difficulty breaking through this defence.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian store operator, the company specializes in selling Russian goods in China.
Russian goods are available online in China's largest trading platforms, such as Small, JD, 1688, Hinduo assidu, ShouQ, and Wechat, and have their own online platforms, Epin.com and Russian merchandise retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with many Russian products to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelf products enterprises.
The store plans to open and shelves products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of the year.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the total number of visits to China's electrical appliance platform is as high as 1 billion each month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and have exceeded $1 billion by 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
The new store will display merchandise from businesses with sales of at least 500 million rupees or more, according to Alexa Kojefnikov.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher and the 500 million roubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green products.
'The competition for the purchasing power of Chinese consumers is fierce and growing, ' he said.
"Our goal is to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years," he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian enterprises in the Far East region of products.
"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a state-owned rather than a private institution," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the basic teaching and research department of trade policy at the Russian Economic University of Plekhanov.
"I don't see a large number of very competitive Russian goods on the market. "
He said the project is likely not to be implemented in real terms, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 products of Russian companies have been released on the largest international wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, and can be purchased in China as well as in other countries, according to the Russian news agency.
There is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training project for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also serve as the organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in trade exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter pavilion, which will also serve as a centre for business events, agreement signing ceremony, referrals and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Russian Export Centre Information Service said: "In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we are bound to have a business meeting, which is to organize direct contacts among entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts, with the aim of supporting enterprises and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them."
There will also be master classes, cooking contests and a Russian food appreciation event for famous chefs in the "Shanghai Station Exploring Russian cuisine" project.
Police waited for a full report and awaited instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office before taking the next step, after the coroner's verdict on Friday that the death was not accidental.
In a statement Friday, the National Police's Directorate of Criminal Investigation, Nabil Huszl, issued a statement saying the police will await further instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office in accordance with the coroner's verdict.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never ceased their investigation into the Morpheus murders, which were still under way.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noazon said police would wait for a full report on the verdict before taking action.
He responded Friday morning when he was questioned about the matter after attending a ceremony at the Xuezhou police headquarters to take over the deputy chief of police.

E-tobacco-related diseases have killed 12 people in the United States and 805 cases of lung damage linked to smoking, U.S. health officials said on Tuesday, according to the Central News Agency.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly notified the figures and said it had not identified specific substances responsible for the disease.
However, most patients have reported using e-tobacco products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, the main chemical that affects the state of the mind in marijuana.
The surge in lung cases has been linked to the purchase of contaminated electronic smoke atomizers in the black market.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the 12 deaths occurred in 10 states from California to Florida, while 805 cases of confirmed and suspected cases were reported in 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.
India and Massachusetts have banned e-tobacco sales in the past three weeks, while New York and Michigan have banned the use of flavored e-tobacco.

What time will the next bus come?
"Internet + Smart Station Card" lets you know.
Nanjing will be lit up with 54 public transport electronic screens when the country's first "Internet + Smart Station Licences" officially landed in Nanjing, a move that will upgrade the city's information-based services in an all-round way, boost the efficiency of public transport services and improve the well-being of its citizens.
In the past, the anxious scenes of waiting for a bus were performed almost daily at the bus stop.
The travel time of buses is unpredictable, the status of bus routes and the location of vehicles along the routes are difficult to learn, and the problem of bus travel pain points is urgently needed to be solved, especially in some big cities.
To this end, Nanjing Intelligent Transportation joins hands with Gao De Map to explore the new direction of "Internet + Transportation" civilian service, launching the first batch of "Internet + Intelligent Station Licence" in China.
The country's first Internet+smart stations have landed in Nanjing, integrating high-degree data and high-degree vehicle estimated driving time ETA algorithms, and relying on bus electronic boards and mobile Internet and traffic data upgrades to achieve the ability of “bus intelligent station boards + electronic maps” to release bus routes and anticipate arrival times.
Through the Internet + smart station card, Nanjing residents can not only easily obtain the expected arrival time of the bus, understand the real-time position of the bus and the distance from the current station, but also can intuitively grasp the bus route along the route through the three colors of red, orange and green, so that all the bus routes through the site can be seen in real-time.
Thanks to the "Internet + Smart Station Card" technology, Nanjing citizens have achieved such a convenient and efficient way of public transportation as "searching bus location before going out, mastering station time when taking bus, and knowing when to get to the destination" .
According to real-time public transport information from the Internet + Smart Station Card, choosing the most suitable route for your trip can also help you to make your trip more convenient and leisurely.

Xinhua Time Review: Firmly and unswervingly follow our own path
In the past 70 years, China's development has been a success because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the right path of development with Chinese characteristics and have unswervingly followed it.
It is the historical choice and the people's choice for China to follow a path that suits its own development.
In modern times, in the environment of poverty, weakness and internal and external troubles, generations of benefactors have gone from generation to generation to seek ways to save the nation and save its people.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system and the presidential system have all considered and tried and failed to work."
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road China has taken is the road of happiness for the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the road of common development for China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right track that China has been able to do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the white paper points out, China's development path, which is in line with China's national conditions and meets the demands of the times, will show more and more bright prospects as the times advance.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this right path even more.
Chinese understand the truth of South Orange and North briers, understand that what suits others is not necessarily suitable for them, but only for themselves is the best.
It is with this sense of road confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that attracts worldwide attention.
In the tortuous course of human progress, the "final conclusion of history" was once famous.
Today, the success of the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the "conclusion of history", the collapse of the "China Collapse Theory", and the failure of the "Socialist Failure Theory".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve national prosperity and strengthen the people's well-being, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for countries and ethnic groups in the world who wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence, thus taking a path that suits their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a path suitable for their own national conditions.
China does not 鈥渋nput鈥?foreign models, nor 鈥渋nport鈥?the Chinese model, but will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen political exchanges with other countries and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a boss of a foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old female worker by text because he preferred to hire workers from Asian backgrounds, whose practices were fiercely criticized as “disgraceful”.
The committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton, owner of Wa<unk>ga's store for more than 20 years, had treated employees "very unfairly" and might have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairman of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found "a number of recruitment advertisements posted by Mr. Wang at various Australian Chinese Employment Forums".
One of the job requirements outlined in these positions says "preferred Asian lady" and the other says "preferred Asian employee".
The third post said he was "more inclined to overseas people" (as it were).
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton in April by text message, later citing her absence and alleged cash shortages at the cash register, which ranged from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked proof.
For three years she had been absent from only one shift and the "missed amount" amounted to a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "in fact irrelevant to her behavior or performance".
"It seems to me that the real motivation behind the dismissal of Mr. Wang, supported by evidence from the job advertisement, was his willingness to hire people with Asian backgrounds," he said.
Under article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant are unlawful."
Sams said that in view of Mr. Wang's "horrifying" treatment of Ms. Aryton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker who earns A$26 an hour.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour-relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his rulings and documents to the commission's supervisor to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be transferred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Aryton any chance to respond to the alleged reason for her dismissal.
"I believe that the respondent has resorted to irretrievably unjust and biased procedures to dismiss the applicant, and that Mr. Wang is "waiting" the opportunity, which he believes will justify the 'proof' termination of employment with the applicant," he said.
"He was wrong ... the respondent, in dismissing the applicant, completely ignored any natural and fair treatment accorded to her and, shockingly, his rude and grossly unjust perfunctory behaviour."
Mr. Sams says that while foodworks is a small business, "it must be honest that no decent employer will dismiss his employees in the most unfair and perfunctory manner acknowledged in this case."
He said: "It is shameful and extremely unfair."

Six people deny the sale of counterfeit poacher's paper for trial in court
Six men suspected of forging and selling our passports, newspapers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Registration Office and a supervisory businessman, were brought before the Court on Thursday and the Court granted leave to refer charges of human trafficking and anti-immigrant trafficking to the High Court.
Among them, the defence lawyer who originally represented the defendant, the Chinese-American defendant, Mr Lai Chun-wah, and Member of Parliament of Sunset Cave, Mr Lear, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant, i.e. to cease to be a defence lawyer for the defendant and obtained approval in court.
He said he had drawn criticism from his political enemies on behalf of the defendant and that his party was involved.
He emphasized that he was not afraid of any threats per se, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to vilify the leaders of the PAP and the Greek Union Governments or other Greek Unions, and that the decision was taken only after careful consideration.
He also noted that there was no conflict of interest between the defendant and a member of Congress and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants. So far, the defendant, Mr Lai Chun-wah, had not been convicted.
The defendants, charged on September 12 this year, faced a number of charges under section 26E of the Anti-Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking Immigration Ordinance and section 466 of the Criminal Code (Forgery of Documents), which denied their guilt and were not granted bail pending trial.
Two court judges, Nosa Ha and Mazlan, approved the prosecution's application on Thursday, following statements from both sides of the case, to bring charges of the anti-smuggling and anti-trafficking immigration laws involving six defendants to trial in the Supreme Court, and forged documents will appear in court on October 3, pending the transfer of documents to the defence.
Earlier, six defendants were arrested under the SOSMA Ordinance (Special Measures for National Security Offences) of 2012, for which no bail was granted by the judge.
Walk with the motherland - A shorthand sketch of an armed police force
Jinqiu, parade training ground, the average height of 1.83 meters of officers and soldiers composed of a team of armed police forces, training is busy.
The gleaming bayonets, the unique olive green, and the bright red epaulet together form a beautiful landscape.
A few days ago, the reporters walked into this armed police officers and soldiers will always be the party and people's loyal guards, as well as their "honour supremacy" feelings and pursuit.
"The dream shines on the glorious life and writes the immortal legend of a new era ..." This is the team song composed by the officers and men of the square army - Walking with the Motherland.
In the square team, this song is the motto of every member.
Qi Xiaoguang, 1.92 meters tall, stands out in the square team.
As the flagbearer of the former armed police national flag guard, he had a deeper understanding of honor.
The honour of a soldier comes from hard training.
Qi Xiaoguang as the flag bearer, training has been high standards and strict requirements.
He practices shaping with sandbags, gait speeds with stopwatches, paces with blindfolds, and stability in the face of strong winds.
In his "Qing Qi career" , there was a picture that remained unforgettable.
At a flag-raising ceremony, heavy rain poured down, but none of the tourists who came to watch the ceremony left.
When the national flag was hoisted, Qi Xiaoguang felt the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
Qi Xiaoguang was chosen as the benchmark soldier to receive the award.
Benchmark soldiers and flag bearers have different standards of movement.
Qi Xiaoguang said that although the marching frequency of Optimus Flag and benchmark soldiers is only 20 paces apart, but the training needs to pay more effort.
Benchmark soldiers are the first in the first row, which determines the level of neatness of the square team.
After concentrating on training in the parade, he kicked his legs repeatedly every day and practiced some hard work.
In the demonstration, he gained the applause of the officers and men with his precise stride and pace.
In the square team, almost every officer and soldier and Qi Xiaoguang have the same experience.
Soldier Zhu Xudong's father joined the 50th anniversary parade of the National Day 20 years ago.
In order to follow his father's footsteps to become a member of the square team, he suffered setbacks time and again, but never discouraged.
He said, "It is an honor in my life to be able to walk through Tian'anmen Square like my father, to be inspected by the Party and the people.
Entering the honor room of the square team, eight words came into view, "The Master of Stability and Sharpness of the Capital".
Wang Qian, the party's political commissar, said the party's members all come from the Armed Police Forces of Beijing - a glorious and traditional force that has undertaken important tasks such as the Founding Ceremony, the National Day celebrations, the security of successive Party congresses and the preservation of terrorism in the capital.

TV play "fox hunting" scenery scenery on the spot to re-emerge the first line through detection dry police demeanor
Hunting Fox, a cross-border catch-up drama, was recently spotted at Tianjin airport. Wang Kai, Wang gull and other actors filmed important roles on the spot, such as escorting suspects to return to their homeland, and the filming was supported by China Southern Airlines.

Vietnam needs to seize the opportunity to develop artificial intelligence.
Four criteria used to evaluate and rank cities' readiness levels for AI waves include foreground, implementation capability, asset base, and development direction.
Singapore ranked first, followed by cities in the UK, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
"When I look back and evaluate cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, I think it makes a lot of sense," Wyman said in an interview with Wyman's experts, who interviewed Mosin Pevanne.
Overall, I think the future of Vietnam is bright against the backdrop of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and a fast-growing talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Vietnam know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote economic growth.
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate and live.
It brings about greater efficiency, but also threatens to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, the only cities in the world today are bracing themselves for a breakthrough in the age of artificial intelligence.
Guterres said he was pleased to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of China together and congratulated the Chinese government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.
"Every time I visit China, I am shocked by the pace of change and progress," Guterres said.
You have created one of the most dynamic economies in the world and helped more than 850 million people out of poverty - the greatest poverty reduction achievement in history.
In its vision of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, he said, China had witnessed revolutionary results: a decline in infant and maternal mortality, an improvement in nutrition, a decline in slow-growing populations and a half reduction in access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
At the same time, China has one of the best education systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world to visit
The photo exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China opens today at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Guterres said this year was also the 40th anniversary of the United Nations presence in China.
Over the past 40 years, China has been a key participant in the work of the United Nations and a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism.
After promoting the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, China is actively implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
As the second largest contributor to the United Nations regular and peace-keeping budgets, China has always been a partner in ensuring the stability of United Nations activities.
China has sent troops to eight peacekeeping missions, including more than 1,000 Blue Helmets, who are on duty in southern Sudan.
“As the United Nations approaches its 75th anniversary, we need to re-establish a global partnership to support multilateral solutions to the global crisis,” Mr Guterres said.
I look forward to China's continued commitment and participation in building a better world for all.
Wang Yi, China's state councilor and foreign minister, said the Chinese people had worked hard over the past 70 years to create an unprecedented opportunity for development.

The world's oldest hairdresser died at the age of 108 with a haircut for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, 108, the world's oldest hairdresser certified by the Guinness Book of World Records in New York, never retired and went to great lengths to get a haircut every day, but died 19 days after complications from jaw cancer, leaving him with a 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mancini immigrated to the United States when he was eight years old and soon helped clean the floors of a barber's shop and, at the age of 12, took up scissors to help ease the financial strain at home.
Mancini went to primary school at the time, but he didn't graduate.
Mancini's son, Robert, reveals that his father loves his job and is loved by people from all over the world, but although he has always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before he died, but this is not a retirement because he plans to come back and have his hair cut when he gets better.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new hairdresser after his father's death, because he had asked his father to help him cut his hair all his life.
China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007]
To stabilize the company's share price and preserve its image, listed companies have been buying back frequently in the past two years, hoping to send the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market through such means as directed buybacks and collective bidding, thus stabilizing the price and enhancing investor confidence.
Share repurchase funds for listed companies jumped from $7.9bn in 2017 to $51bn in 2018, according to Choice, the Eastern Fortune Group.The total amount of repurchase funds for A-listed companies has exceeded $100bn since population planning, setting a record high of historical repurchase funds for A-shares and well over the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the repurchase shares of the company seem to be the same as that of the majority shareholders, but there are great differences in implementing the main body, source of funds, use of the repurchase, and equity of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based McKrong Information Co., Ltd., told the Securities Daily that the "Opinions on Supporting Share Repurchase by Listed Companies" issued in November 2018 had been revised to address the problems of the existing system, including the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and imperfect inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued the “Implementation Rules for the Share Repurchase of Listed Companies”, which broadened the sources of funds for the repurchase of listed companies, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various types of listed companies to implement equity incentive or employee ownership schemes.
After the publication of opinions, listed companies to carry out share repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, repurchase process more simple, share repurchase enthusiasm is even more.
Repurchase of shares in a relatively low position will also help listed companies to use their funds more efficiently, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, raising the return on equity and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
Compared with the majority shareholders, the repurchase shares of listed companies have more significance, reflecting the willingness of listed companies to active market value management and abundant cash flow.
Mr Xu believes that undervalued share prices are a major factor in the repurchase of listed companies, whose share prices no longer reflect the future prospects of the company, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but cannot blindly invest, and need to pay attention to the earnings and operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The growing enthusiasm for repurchase of A-listed companies has also normalized repurchase, with figures showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchase this year and that leading companies in all sectors have become the mainstay of the repurchase market.
China Ping An recently disclosed progress in the repurchase that the company had acquired a total of 57.59 million shares of A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total equity, through a centralized bidding process. The total funds paid for the repurchase will be $5 billion (excluding transaction costs) and the repurchase shares will be used exclusively for the employee shareholding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan approved by the company's shareholders meeting.
Yili has paid $5,795 million for share repurchase and has recently adjusted the use of the repurchase shares from the original plan that “all of the repurchase shares will be used as a source of late incentives” to “accumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million will be used as a source of incentives and the remaining 30.49 million will be used for write-offs to reduce registered capital”.
Yili said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help further raise earnings per share and boost earnings per share of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a notice on the progress of the repurchase, TCL Group repurchase of 3.59% of the company's shares, costing a total of 1.65 billion yuan.
Repurchase shares will be used for employee ownership plans, equity incentives or convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies, the TCL board office told the Securities Daily.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves its competitiveness and sustains healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the protection of investors' interests, the company plans to repurchase the company's shares through self-financing, self-financing and other means of financing, taking into account the performance of the secondary market of the company's shares in the past year and taking into account its operating and financial position.
Yang Delong, the former chief economist of the Sea Open Source Fund, said the operation of listed companies to buy back shares would, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important plus to secondary market share prices.
In recent years, the repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased, especially the outstanding stocks. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through repurchase of shares, and it is also worthy of approval and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and Hu Henghua, secretary of the Party committee of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and the four major gates of the Xiangjun Army of Construction Machinery Manufacturing 鈥?Zhan Zhenxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang set a 鈥渓ixiang鈥?goal goal鈥?on Changsha 鈥?from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing 鈥?to build a world-leading cluster of engineering machinery industries in three or five years.
To build a world-leading cluster of construction machinery industries in Changsha, in the current fashion, is to build "the strongest surface" .
As the capital city of inland province, Changsha shouted out this bravado, where does the spirit come from?
It depends on the power of bullying.
The four Xiang enterprises that participated in the dialogue are all capable of doing so, covering all areas of the sky, underground, sea and land: the intelligent light aircraft of the mountains and rivers, the concrete pumps of the Central Lianzhong Heavy Industries, the all-ground cranes of Trinity Heavy Industries, and the tunnel shields of iron heavy builders.
There was a time when China had little say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
With the east wind of the acquisition, merger, planting and so on, China's enterprises have jumped to the forefront of the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, the major economic indicators, such as output value, market share, sales, etc., of Sanyi Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, and Shanhe Intelligent Construction Machinery, have led similar enterprises by a large margin.
The momentum is driven by the camera.
The "Four Great Diamonds" of the Xiangjun Army of Construction Machinery is the leader of the Changsha Construction Machinery Industry Cluster and the head of the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industry of rivers and lakes, who can live and live well, is the harshness of speech.
In the past few years, the global construction machinery industry has suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturers have collapsed, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturers have taken the "cat winter" as a "winter stroke", self-stressing, self-breakthrough, through the industrial restructuring, from manufacturing to intellectual development, not only survived, but also strengthened their bodies.
With all the stars holding the moon's political and enterprises together.
Developing advantageous industries not only requires enterprises to enterprisingly, but also requires the government to act actively.
Changsha enjoys the reputation of being a capital of construction machinery by pooling the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creating clusters of related industries, and reducing the cost of research and development, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services and simplifying the examination and approval process.
Good business ecological, so that construction machinery manufacturing enterprises crowded to come.
History has pushed Changsha to the foreground of building the world's leading level of engineering machinery.
Whether it is the government, enterprises or even related industries, researchers and researchers should seize the opportunity, go up with the tide, set goals, and make continuous efforts to contribute Hunan's strength to the building of a manufacturing powerhouse.
Wang presided over the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African countries members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said China and African countries are good brothers and good partners.
China stands firmly with its African brethren, past, present and future.
We advocate the holding of this meeting of foreign ministers as a concrete measure to implement the important consensus reached between China and African leaders at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September last year, in order to strengthen China's solidarity and cooperation with African countries in the Security Council, and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Mr Wang said Africa was China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Security Council has always belonged to the vast majority of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries in the Security Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and safeguard common interests.
The two sides should unite to resolve disputes through consultation, seek self-reliance and govern by development.
The Foreign Ministers of the African member states thanked China for its initiative in convening the meeting and congratulated New China on its 70th anniversary.
The Foreign Ministers stated that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been the most trustworthy and reliable partners.
The African side appreciates the important and positive role played by China as a permanent member of the Security Council in Africa's affairs, has effectively promoted a just and reasonable settlement of Africa's problems, and has made tremendous efforts and contributions to safeguarding African interests and promoting African peace and security.
At present, Africa is facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and long-term peaceful development in Africa can only be achieved if security problems are solved.
We look forward to further coordinating our position and strengthening unity and cooperation with China in the Security Council.
Wang said that today's meeting reached an important consensus.
We all agree to strengthen mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and safeguard the common interests of the developing countries.We all support African countries in solving Africa's problems in an African way and request the United Nations to provide financial support for Africa's independent peace operations.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Lake sheep carrying "poverty relief" .
Autumn in September paints the Loess Plateau.
A 58-year-old villager fills a last shovel of fodder into a feeding trough in a sheepfold at Yimin Farming Co-operative, a post-horse town, to watch the white lakes goat munch.
"It's delicious. We'll wait until the autumn and winter get fat before we sell it for a good price. "
He says he feeds sheep "special nutritional meals" every day, regularly cleans them up, sterilizes them, and treats them with meticulous attention.
She kept sheep for more than 20 years and didn't know how extensive sheep were until she came to work as a co-operative.
Xia Weili is a villager of Xia waterlogging pool in Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional sheep-raising methods, poor quality of sheep, small outflow.
In June, under the guidance of the government, 140 impoverished villagers joined the co-operative society, and everything began to change.
Chavial spent all day in the fields of farming, for he was always suffocating.
The shareholders were all poor people, who trusted the sheep to the co-operatives, and were counting on him for a dividend and a higher price at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he gradually learnt to prevent epidemic diseases, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few breeding "good handle" in the village.
Yimin Aquaculture Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative, with 16 sheep sheep shelters and nearly 1,400 lakes.
Cooperatives in charge of Zou Tao said that the standard sheep sheep shelter inside and outside, are very doorway.
"The wool is thick and bacteria-prone, the lakes and sheep cannot stay in hot and humid places, the shelters must be built on three sides of the gully, and a ventilator must be installed to ventilate and dissipate heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, also needs to regularly spray the sheep sheep shed disinfection, to give the sheep three to four times a season of vaccination.
Besides living well, Little Sheep must eat a mixture of silage corn, straw and alfalfa and have a broad enough playground for them to stretch their legs.
The cooperative adopts the approach of custody and surveillance, and guides local farmers to put good breeding lakes and sheep here, and unifiedly raises, manages and sells them, so as to achieve good breeding, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poverty-stricken households with sheep equity shares receive more than 6,000 yuan a year from each household.
From mountain grazing to precise feeding, from “local mating” to “artificial insemination”, from “looking at the body, touching the belly” to “doing one by one” “B-ultrason.” In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat sheep farming is not just a transformation of feeding methods.
If the market price is weak, Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., a local leading company in Gansu, will make a $27-a-kilogram underlying bid to help farmers diversify their market risks, Mr. Zou said.
Xu Jianfeng, chief adviser to Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., in Gansu province, said the growing number of poor households are being driven by services such as loan guarantees, sheep farming, order farming, bid acquisitions and unified processing and sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 impoverished families have achieved steady increases in their income by joining China's flourishing farmers and herds through forage farming, breeding of good seeds, large-scale farming, slaughter and segmentation, and marketing.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agriculture and animal husbandry crisscross zone, rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale farms and cooperatives for meat and sheep in the city, with more than 5 million meat and sheep raised, and two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-sized production lines have been built.
France's finance minister said it would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit
LONDON (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday that France would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemaire said the ECB's latest monetary easing measures created an opportunity for governments in able member states to invest more.
The ECB cut interest rates to record lows on September 12th and plans to restart debt purchases in an effort to drive down borrowing costs in hopes of stimulating economic recovery and pushing up inflation.
"Low interest rates won't bring prosperity back to Europe and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " he told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until things get worse, " he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, which have boosted its economic growth.
And the global economy is losing momentum, with export-dependent Germany bearing the brunt.
Lemel points out that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 鈧?.3bn next year, including 5bn in income tax credits.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros over a five-year period from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent.

US National Healthy Diet Index Rises Smallly but Still Challenges - China Net
The U.S. government's Healthy Diet Index has increased modestly over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new study.
But with a full score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutritional researcher at the University of Tafts in Massachusetts who co-authored the study, said Americans still consume too much food, which is the most common cause of heart disease, diabetes and obesity among Americans.
The study appears in the 24th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on a government health survey of 44, 000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "in spite of significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain".
These challenges include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter and other foods that contain saturated fat.
The study found that people's dietary intake of these unhealthy fats rose from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, more than the recommended 10 percent limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was the decrease in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but consumption remained too high.
Officials believe that added sugar intake should be less than 10% of the diet.
But Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adult consumption of fruit, nuts, oats and other whole grain foods increased slightly in the United States.
However, 2016 data show that these foods still account for less than 5 percent of the diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and a decrease in fruit juice consumption that has led to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang said they still account for as much as 42 percent of the calories per day, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that reminds adults of what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
A government guide to Americans' diets recommends "healthy eating patterns" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seeds that provide protein.
The number of Americans with diabetes almost doubled during the survey period to more than 7 percent, and the obesity rate has increased in the many years between surveys - about 70 percent of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.
EU Promotes Strategic Partnership with Asia

These relations help bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
He also believes the EU wants to send a message about increasing participation and strengthening the mutually beneficial and docking relationship between Europe and Asia.

China Railway Tunnel Shaft Sets New Record
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) (Zhang Weiming Hui, China) After more than 1,200 days of day-and-night construction, a record of 762.59 metres below ground level was set in the construction of the Dali (Li) Rui (Ri) Railway Tunnel No.1 shaft on the 27th, breaking the record of the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China.
The 34.5 km-long Tauri Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel is located in Yunnan Province. The tunnel crosses the Gaoligong Mountains from the wrathful Jiangxi coast and is the longest one-way tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel, which runs through 19 faulted zones, has a maximum depth of 1,155 meters because it covers almost all of the possible adverse geological and major risks to be encountered in the construction of the tunnel, and is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan tunnel, which shoulders the important task of increasing the working face to realize the "long tunnel short-cut" and the ventilation of the later railway operation.
The successful excavation of No.1 shaft into the bottom of the well marks the official entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel.
"The shafts are all in granite formations, where there are many fissures and there is no stopping the flow of water from top to bottom.
Zhao Shi, chief engineer of the Darui Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, there were many dangers such as mud-rush water and collapse, and the builder invited experts to pulse the site and discuss the treatment plan for more than 20 times.
"The maximum inflow of water from the shaft is over 300 cubic meters per hour and 700 meters deep at the bottom of the well, with a pressure equal to 700 meters deep.
"If we don't pump the water in time, we'll submerge the well 10 meters an hour. Almost 85 percent of our time is spent on water treatment and 15 percent on digging," he said.
In order to overcome the geological difficulties such as the longitudinal joint development, water inrush and water-rich granite in No.1 shaft, a systemic water-control measure combining "probe, injection and excavation" is adopted in tunnel construction to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No.1 shaft has formed a mechanical pipeline, such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch lifting system.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of day-and-night construction, the shaft completed the excavation of 762.59 meters depth smoothly.
The 330 kilometer-long Darui railway is an important part of the international route between China and Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the construction of the 鈥渋nfrastructure鈥?
Upon completion and opening to traffic, Dali's driving time to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours on the current highway to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan area and promote economic, trade and people-friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Does Ma Hua take part in the by-election for the State Assembly of Dundee in Johor?
Ma Hua General Director Na Governor of the State Council of the Wei Jiaxiang: " The Supreme Council of the National Front! "
Whether Ma Hua, a member of the National Front Party, is on the run for the traditional seat is a matter of concern.
However, after a meeting of the Central Committee of China, it was announced that it would be referred to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional seat should continue to be occupied by Ma or replaced by other member parties.
Mr. Wei told the media after hosting a meeting of the Chinese Central Committee of Ma on Thursday afternoon that any by-election would be conducted under the standard operating procedures SOP, which would require a meeting of the FIF's Supreme Council to be finalized.
He said the FRODEBU's Supreme Council is scheduled to meet in early October, as the electoral commission will not meet until next Monday to finalize the by-election of Dantebye.
"Yesterday morning 26th, I also met with the president of the National Front, Governor Nasri Ahmed Al-Zahi, and we all agreed that this seat must be retrieved from the Union of Hope.
"We have decided to convene a special National Front leadership meeting in early October, and the leader of the three parties will determine which of the members will run. "
Asked whether Mr Ma would stick to the traditional seat of the National Front's Supreme Council, Mr Wei reiterated that, as President Ma, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures. Any decision must therefore be agreed by the National Front.
"In any by-election, it is not uncommon for people to be willing to go on a campaign, political parties, and some quarters to think they should come out."
"And most importantly, what organizations and political alliances do we come from?
"This is a great test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the National Front has been carrying some valuable values along the way. "
"It's no wonder that someone might say something in the process. "
"However, once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, it is most valuable that all must be prepared to fight. "

A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced to hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan (RMB, below).
Because the defendant's family is poor, the procuratorial organs use substitute labor to compensate for the ecological restoration cost, and realize the unification of legal effect and social effect.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy prosecutor-general of the Baokang County Procuratorate, said Wednesday that through three months of "voluntary mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou has established a deep affection with wild macaques, and was deeply remorseful of their predatory behavior.
On June 21, the Baokang County Procuratorate filed a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit in the field of ecological resources, which was heard in the county court and pronounced in court.
Defendant Zhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, four years' probation and a fine of 3,000 yuan, and ordered to pay compensation to the defendant for the environmental damages caused by ecological resources.
Zhou has set up a power grid on the cliffs since late January 2014. He has hunted more than 20 wild animals, including wildebeests, chamois and fur-lined deer.
Gazelle belongs to the second class of endangered wildlife conservation in the country. Small suede and fur crown deer are listed as the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, Zhou confessed his wrongful facts and conduct, and was willing to accept the incidental civil liability.
However, considering that Zhou's family's economic situation is relatively poor, local villagers' committees, forest stations and a tripartite agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration was reached under the coordination of Baokang County Prosecutor's Office.
The court endorsed the prosecutor's recommendation, agreeing that Zhou should suspend his sentence while actively fulfilling his obligation to "substitute labor compensate for ecological repair costs" .
At present, Zhou has been in the monkey sanctuary volunteer labor for 3 months, active mountain patrol, good performance.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has, in practice, organically integrated procuratorial functions and social governance acts.It has scientifically used such supervisory methods as procuratorial suggestions, investigation supervision and litigation supervision to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
The UN presented the Earth Guardian Prize for Ant Forest.
Amid loud applause and loud music, Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang, head of the Ant Forest project, walked onto the podium and took the UN Earth Guard trophy in red from the hosts' hands.
The Ant Forest Project, which used small mobile phone programs to get hundreds of millions of people involved in environmental activism, was awarded the Earth Guard Prize on Tuesday in New York.
The United Nations Environment Programme announced its awards a week ago at its headquarters in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, but the crowd at the ceremony remained unnerved.
"The Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what human beings can do for the environment," UN Environment Programme Executive Director Ying Er Anosheng told Xinhua.
It uses technology to link people and the environment so that every individual can participate in protecting the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The ant forest, launched by China Ant Financial Services Corp. in August 2016 on the Alipay platform, saves "green energy" to plant trees on mobile phones through low-carbon operations such as keeping track of green travel in the Ant forest and paying water and electricity bills online.
Each time a user develops a virtual tree, Ant Forest and a public-interest partner plant a real tree in a desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million users of Ant Forest have cut carbon emissions by 9.2 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica was named the winner of the Earth Guardian Prize for its national environmental efforts, and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvalado paid tribute on the spot to the contribution of the Ant Forest, "it was impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green action".
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ant King Service, said the Earth Guardian Prize was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, and this honour belongs to all participants.
In the past three years, “ants' forests” have affected 500 million people, and over the next three years “ants' forests” are aimed at encouraging one billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon operations, according to Mr Tseng.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to make farmers earn more from green hills and streams.
In addition to providing employment opportunities by planting trees, it also hopes to help farmers increase their income through agricultural development projects and electricity generation platforms.
"The ant forest" created a digital technology-based public welfare environmental model has also been successfully seabed, by other countries to learn from.
In June, GCash, the country's largest electronic wallet, launched the Philippine version of the ant forest, encouraging Philippine users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
GCash, along with the Philippines' Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental NGOs, plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, the company said.
The Earth Guardian Award is the highest award in the United Nations environmental protection field and is awarded annually.
Ant Forest won the prize for the third year in a row for green innovation projects from China, following China's Saihanba Forest Farm Builder and Zhejiang Province's "Qiancun Demonstration and Wancun Remediation" project.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy.
US GDP growth slowed markedly in the second quarter of this year from the previous quarter as private sector investment and exports fell sharply.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought were the main causes of the second quarter decline in private sector investment and exports.
US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the second quarter, flat on previous revisions, but significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter, according to final revisions released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th.
Data show that consumer growth was a major driver of U. S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 percent in the quarter, boosting growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drive economic growth of 0.82 percentage points.
However, private-sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down growth of 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter; and net exports dragged down growth of 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter.
Far from maintaining the momentum of last year's growth, private-sector investment has fallen sharply, according to Barry Knap, managing partner at Enside Macroeconomic Consulting, a US-based consultancy, as rising economic and trade frictions and uncertainty have hit business confidence.
Mr Knap believes US corporate capital spending is still expected to decline next year amid policy uncertainty.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth has provided a strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that trade and economic friction and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and adversely affect the outlook for U.S. consumption.
Richard Curtin, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest rate in a year and a half.
Analysts generally believe the U. S. economy will continue to slow in the future.
But other experts say the performance of the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions are alleviated.
Kathleen Burch, global economist at the British Economist's think tank, expects the US economy to continue its downward trend this year to a lower rate than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year, on the assumption that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate, and will slow further to 1.6 percent next year.
'The biggest concern now is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring,' says Ellen Hutchin, investment manager at Patnam Investments. 'If the trade disputes are resolved, the uncertainty will be substantially reduced and the industry sector will perform much better than it is now.
Matt Merry, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions remained a "first priority" and a major cause of this year's ups and downs in U.S. capital markets. A proper resolution of the economic and trade frictions will be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off each year in Ningxia
Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
This is the first provincial level in Ningxia to promulgate a comprehensive and systematic local regulations to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be formally implemented on November 1, 2008.
The Regulations, which were amended on the basis of the “Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women” adopted in Ningxia in 2007, are divided into 9,65 sections, including general principles, political rights, cultural rights and interests, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and supplementary provisions.
Under the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which is the first in the country.
In April this year, the Guidance Notes on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children Under 3 Years of Age, issued by the General Office of the State Council, contained relevant descriptions of co-parenting.
In the course of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has innovated the idea of "encouraging employers to grant joint parental leave of 10 days to husbands and wives each year between the ages of zero and three for couples who have children in compliance with laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlighted anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations, which incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the civil code of China's civil law on the right of personality, details the constitutional elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits frequent sexual assaults against girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, thus becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Regulations explicitly stipulates that women's right to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration bodies and related bodies shall provide solid institutional support for women's protection of their rights.
In addition, in response to gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders that indirect discrimination be prohibited. It also draws on the latest practices of joint treaty negotiation, strengthens the punishment of illegal acts of gender discrimination and strengthens the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation Joint Public Inspection and Law Department, civil affairs and other departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing social professional forces to mediate disputes over marital and family conflicts and in combating domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.A number of laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Academician Yuan Longping Working Station of Inner Mongolia Xing'an Alliance
Reporter 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xing'an Union's administrative office learned that the recently held "Xing'an alliance Yuan Longping Academician's workstation on-the-spot inspection and acceptance of saline-alkali-tolerant rice assessment and acceptance council" good news, saline-alkali-tolerant rice average per mu yield of rice over 1,000 jin.
An expert group of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and the Agricultural and Rural Department of Hunan Province gathered on-the-spot sampling and harvesting of the saline-making series of rice.
The average yield of saline-tolerant alkaline rice per mu was 508.8 kilograms of rice on soils with PHs of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity of 5 per thousand to 6 per thousand.
Wang Shigang, executive director of the workstation of academician Yuan Longping of the Xing'an Alliance, said: "Our next step is to make innovations on the basis of this year's experiments and to re-cultivate and optimize saline-tolerant alkaline rice varieties for better quality and higher yield."
"On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that we will continue to strengthen our scientific and technological efforts and the salt-tolerant alkaline rice will continue to work miracles on the saline-alkali soil," said Lai Yongcai, associate dean and researcher of the Heilongjiang Agricultural Academy of Sciences, head of the expert group on production measurement.
Xing'an alliance belongs to the southern foothills of Daxing'anling area which is closely connected with the film.
In October 1992, Academician Yuan Longping was working at the Xing'an Union to unveil his work.
Prof. Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the newly cultivated hybrid saline-alkali-tolerant rice varieties and advanced technologies, and to build a 960-acre saline-alkali-tolerant rice base in the right-wing flag of Horqin.
The field yield measurement of saline-tolerant alkali-tolerant rice not only provides a scientific basis for promoting low- and middle-yield saline-alkali-tolerant rice fields in Xing'an alliance, but also for planting saline-alkali-tolerant rice under the same conditions in China.
Abortion legalization law was passed in Australia's new state on September 26th after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, the Australian Web site reported.
The bill is understood to have sparked political debate in the past eight weeks, with serious divisions within the Liberal Party since Independent Congressman George Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, Australia's new state Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by 26 to 14 votes on the night, making it the third longest-running one in the state's Senate, the report said.
Abortion was legalized in the New State on the 26th morning after a final vote in the House of Representatives.
The law allows women to terminate their pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, to abort later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on the night of the 25th, allowing doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of hospital advisory committees before performing abortions for women 22 weeks after conception.
In addition, the Senate's amendments include the need for doctors to provide adequate care for babies that survive the termination of pregnancy.
The new governor had faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill, which she stepped in repeatedly to get more debate time, but did not attend the final vote.
"I need to take the time to manage the whole new state," she said in defence of her absentee ballot.
Abortion lawmaker David Davis, who was the strongest opponent of the proposed abortion bill, threatened to leave the new state government, saying it triggered a "government crisis".
But then Davis gave in.
"Twenty-six amendments to the Abortion Legalization Act submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning actually provide more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, Australia's new state party leader, Barry Laro, says he is proud to be part of a government that legalizes abortion.
"Our achievements last night were historic for the state, legalizing abortion, making abortion no longer a crime and treating abortion women as criminals.
Three-one group of major projects settled in Zhuzhou.
A total of 15 billion yuan was invested in the development of the petroleum intelligent equipment and steel industry.
Today, the Zhuzhou Municipal People's Government and Trinity Group held a project signing ceremony.
Trinity Group has invested 15 billion yuan to develop industrial projects in Zhuzhou, such as the Intelligent Iron and Steel Industry, the Petroleum Intelligent Equipment and Regional Research and Development Center (HQ Base), and the market of used automobiles for construction machinery, with an annual comprehensive output value of more than 200 billion yuan.
With a total investment of $10 billion, the Trinity Intelligent Iron and Steel Industry Project will be located in the Lotus Pond area, focusing on making it the largest iron and steel and product trading centre in the province and central China, as well as the Trinity Group Intelligent Manufacturing and Processing Centre for Metal Structures.
At the same time, Trinity Group will also be in Zhuzhou high-tech development zone in the gasoline park construction machinery second-hand automobile market, in the intelligent manufacturing and other fields to carry out practical cooperation.
Zhuzhou City attaches great importance to cooperation with Trinity Group.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 86.01 billion yuan to enrich their social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 86.01 billion yuan, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.
Liu Kun made the above remarks at a joint meeting of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State-owned Capital Enrichment Fund on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full embodiment of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system, as well as a policy measure based on the current and long-term considerations."
In 1992, the State Council issued the Implementation Programme for Transferring Parts of State-owned Capital Enrichment Social Security Fund, which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been transferred in three batches, with a total transfer capital of about $860.1 billion.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions by the Ministry of Finance to perform the functions of investors has been basically completed.
Central enterprises have been transferred to a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stages of enterprise transfer were carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 1.58 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan transferred to state-owned capital respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preparatory work in advance, laying a foundation for the next step of implementation of the transfer.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, the State Assets Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of part of state-owned capital from the central and local governments to the enriched social security funds will be fully pushed away in 2008, and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made a concrete deployment of the overall departure of the transfer exercise.
The meeting stressed that the transfer should be done in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
“According to the schedule, the transfers will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Working time is tight and the task is heavy.
Liu said all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed according to the requirements, promote solid work and accurately grasp the contents of the transfer policy, and strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-owned funds are transferred to enrich social security funds Starting from the "enrichment of the fund's purse", the aim is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement" but rather a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources, the State-owned Capital Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice on the Comprehensive Promotion of the Work of Transferring Parts of State-owned Capital to Enriched Social Security Funds, clarifying the timetable for transferring state-owned capital to social security funds, i.e. the central and local transfers of part of state-owned capital to enriched social security funds, which were fully pushed away in U.S.
After the documents were published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Treasury transferred 10 per cent of its stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of more than $115bn.
According to the regulations, social security funds and other undertaking bodies, as financial investors, enjoy the income, disposal and information rights assigned to state-owned shares.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China said in the announcement that the change in interests will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author thinks that the similar transfer of state-owned enterprises equity is not a simple change of ownership, but a series of "adder operations" which can inspire a series of effects.
The first "addition result" of the transfer of some state-owned enterprises to social security naturally reflects the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people, and the achievements of development are shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, most of the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are in important industries and fields in our country's economy.
Among them, the leading enterprises are the continuous realization of do better and bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided that the transfer of some of the state-owned capital to enrich social security funds should be pushed aside this year.
The Ministry of Finance said it would work with relevant departments to fully push forward the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in accordance with the arrangements of the Standing Meeting of the State Council and fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of "addition result" is to enhance the sustainability of our social security funds and further strengthen the foundation of the social security system for the aged.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure.Nowadays, most of the state-owned enterprises that have been transferred have the ability to make profits and pay dividends continuously, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide the source of the social security funds.
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the deposit ratio of basic endowment insurance for enterprises can be reduced by one percentage point.
The third step of the rotation, "additional results", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The sub-contractor of the main way to obtain income is "dividend-based, operation as a subsidiary" .
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, social security funds are mainly concerned with the income from equity dividends.
However, as a value investor of capital market, social security fund has a strong capability of capital operation.
As for listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which is conducive to enhancing the management level of enterprises, and will have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase in equity holdings of social security funds is conducive to further enhancing their influence in the market, and plays a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guide them to invest rationally and invest in value.

Iran Confirmed to Develop Advanced Centrifuges for Further Suspension of Implementation of Iran's Nuclear Accord
Iran has once again violated its nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to make uranium enrichment, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Monday, according to a news agency.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the restrictions imposed by the Iranian nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of U.S. President Trump 2018 from the Iranian nuclear agreement, the resumption and tightening of sanctions.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July, keeping its stock of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and its purity of enriched uranium at no more than 3.67 per cent, and is making further moves.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran has only about 5,000 first-generation IIR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, while allowing Iran to use only a few more advanced models for research without producing enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium at several times the speed of a nuclear bomb.
The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: "On September 25th, the Agency confirmed that Iranian research and development models 2 and 3 advanced centrifuges ... are accumulating or preparing to accumulate enriched uranium."
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to the Member States on the 26th, a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at [Nantes uranium enrichment] facilities."

The Italian education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect people's health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, education minister and member of the five-star movement, has proposed to parliament a new tax on sugary drinks, snacks and airline tickets.
According to reports, under a bill introduced by education minister Fiora Monti, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on sugary drinks, snacks and other unhealthy foodstuffs, as well as an environmental tax on air tickets, 1 euro for domestic flights and 1.5 euros for international flights.
Mr Fiori Monti said the government expects to receive 3bn euros (鈧?bn, 锟?bn) in taxes through a series of seemingly small tax measures.
The proceeds of the tax will be used for education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Prime Minister Conte said he thought it was a viable solution; Italian parliamentarians, European lawmakers and coalition leader Silvio Berlusconi sent a message of sarcasm saying that everyone should hide their desserts, cookies, bread and candy as soon as possible because the new government would start imposing a snack tax.
The report notes that a snack tax generally refers to the imposition of a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
The levy of the tax helps to bring about public health benefits.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
(New China 70 Years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper said that as China's overall national strength and international influence have risen rapidly, some people in the world are concerned that China will take the path of "powerful and strong" hegemony, and some have come up with so-called "China Threat Theory".
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-seated biases, psychological imbalances resulting from declining power, and deliberate distortions to protect vested interests.
It is the Chinese people's dream and the common dream of all peoples to realize the prosperity and strength of the country, rejuvenation of the nation and well-being of the people.
"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world. "
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, and China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth.China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and the role of China's economic stabilizer and power source in the future has become more prominent.
At present the world economic growth power is insufficient, the sound Chinese economy is more and more important to the world.
China's economy is changing from high-speed growth to economic growth.New industrialization, information technology, urbanization and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is being deeply adjusted, industries are being optimized and upgraded continuously, and new economic growth points are emerging.
"According to the McKinsey Global Research Institute study, by 2040, the convergence of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to generate $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26 percent of the world's total economy, and increased cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create enormous economic value.
The white paper stressed that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes, deep integration.
China, with its more stable economic operation, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is good for the world economy in the long run.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains to “decouple” China from the world economy by looking at its economic development as a “threat” and “challenge”.
The white paper points out that all-round opening to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend" .
China resolutely pursues a win-win and win-win strategy of opening up to the outside world, achieves greater force and a higher level of opening-up.China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and a larger-scale “going out” benefits more countries.
"Opening should be two-way, mutually beneficial, and not one-way, one-way, one-way street.
Mutual benefit is long-term and lasting."
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection,' the white paper said.
Only when all sides meet one another can they create an environment of openness, tolerance, universal benefit, balanced and win-win development, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, so as to form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods for the international community.
They include promoting high-quality cooperation, setting up a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited from the international community and has always given back to the international community to provide more and better public goods to the international community.
In a recent written interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Strepnikov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said Russia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of trade and economics, further optimize its export structure and promote diversification of Russian exports to China.
While the forestry, mechanical manufacturing and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, exports of agricultural products are also important, including fat products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood, he said.
In recent years, the export of non-material and non-energy products from Russia to China has also shown a good and stable trend of development.
Speaking of the optimization of Russia's export structure to China, Mr. Slipchenoff said Russia has set the task of expanding exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions, including China.
Russia will then improve financial and non-financial support measures to further increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
Russia is ready to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and develop cooperation with China in the fields of pharmaceuticals and aviation manufacturing, he said.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He emphasized that Russian products in many fields were "quality-advantageous and price-competitive" compared with similar Western products.
Speaking of the two countries' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Mr. Strepnikov said the fields of agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving that goal.
Russia intends to diversify supplies in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He emphasized that Russia was pushing its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China was one of the directions.
Manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, petroleum and natural gas, and chemicals in Russia are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises by "establishing more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly developing exports to third countries".
Mr. Slipchenoff said the Russian Export Centre was taking a variety of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support Russian exports to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to facilitate the access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of export products to China.

The Foreign Ministry responds to what the Taiwanese side calls a diplomatic breakthrough: covert self-degradation
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuangqiang responded to a regular press conference on religion-related issues when Taiwanese officials entered the UN headquarters recently, saying the move was "infamous" and "laughingly generous".
Taiwanese media reported that officials of Taipei offices in New York had entered United Nations Headquarters to attend a conference on religion held in the United States, calling it a "diplomatic breakthrough".
The meeting you mentioned was a side meeting held by the United States on United Nations premises, not at all by the United Nations.

He pointed out that the United Nations side reiterated on many occasions its adherence to the one-China principle of handling the Taiwan question in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758.

/[^#39^#108^#230^#108^#105^#110^#116^#105^#116^#105^#116]/n. The authorities showed strong repression
Twitter-themed labels and community media are pressing Egyptians to take to the streets today and peacefully appeal to President Cecil to step down.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
The dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt since the then military chief, Jose Sessi, seized power in the 2013 military coup, and any form of protest could be in extreme danger.
Britain's Guardian reports that the Cairo-based NGO, the Center for Economic and Social Rights in Egypt, says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests calling for Mr. Cecil to step down.
Thousands of people took to the streets on the 20th, following allegations of corruption over Mr. Cecil and his family's profligate pursuit of vanity.
Egypt's Interior Ministry insisted yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be resolute and not soft.
The heart of Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police on the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's revolutionary detonation in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Cairo University political science professor and well-known columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cecil would be disastrous, " he wrote on the 24th.
It is in Egypt's interest that he should step down immediately.
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, a former spokesman for the Egyptian military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Cecil for the presidency.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Daoud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that sweeping away dissidents at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and middle class are worsening reflects the instability and fragility of the government.
"The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears," said the opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who was once running for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, coupled with widespread political repression, Mr. Cecil is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who could take his place. "
Mr. Knoll noted that the government's repressive approach only increases people's anger as the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken through, he expects more people to take to the streets.
The exiled Spanish businessman and actor Ali, a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began posting a series of films earlier this month that benefited from government corruption, triggering a wave of small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, Amrak, did not have to go through a legal bidding process to secure lucrative contracts, emphasizing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful that he had been involved in it.
Ali claimed that his stately palaces and luxury hotels, which helped Mr Sessigue, contrasted sharply with the dire poverty of the Egyptians and had yet to pay for them.
On Twitter, topical labels such as "Stand up and you're not alone", "Cissy is dead", "Cisseyed is rolling" and "Next Friday" have drawn tens of thousands of tweets and rejections calling for a peaceful exit from the streets.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amawick has nearly seven million followers on Twitter.
He said yesterday in Arabic: "Cissy is doomed. . . He's done. His supporters are making a big mistake now."
Hong Kong Government Launches Free Special Training Scheme for Economically Affected Employees
The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) announced on the 27th that a free special training scheme for employees affected by the recent economic situation will be introduced. Eligible trainees will receive a maximum monthly training allowance of HK$4,000 upon completion of the programme.
Many boutiques in the harbour city of Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong have very few customers.
As a result of the recent social strife in Hong Kong, visitor arrivals have dropped considerably in recent years. Apart from the tourism industry, the hotel, catering and retail industries have been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Matthew Law Chi-kwong, and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Edward Yau, met with the media on the commissioning of the Employees Retraining Board to launch a special training programme and measures to support the tourism industry.
Mr Law said the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy were imminent and that work should not wait until the situation was calm.
As a result, the HKSAR Government has launched a free training programme called "Special Value-added Love".
People who are unemployed or required by their employers to take unpaid leave on or after June 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the Scheme provided they meet the relevant requirements, the spokesman said.
Mr Law noted that the programmes covered a wide range of topics, the most important of which was "occupational skills" training, covering 19 trades, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as some innovative "innovation" courses, as well as "universal skills" courses across industries.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, Mr. YU Pengchun, said all courses were free of tuition and the Scheme was expected to support about 10,000 needy persons.
Participants who complete each full-time or part-time course and attend 80% of the courses will receive a special allowance, subject to a maximum monthly allowance of HK$4,000.
The two-to-three-month training course is offered by some 50 training institutions. Members of the public can take up to four courses from 3 October to 31 March next year.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to help the industry weather the storm.
These measures include relaxing funding to the Travel Industry Council, subsidising 6,000 re-enrolment courses for tourist guides and exempting travel agents from annual fee.
Exercise tired people also tired brain?
According to a study of athletes, the brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, the Russian satellite network reported.
The study, led by Dr. Marcellus Pesiligon, a specialist at the Piltier-Salpetrier Hospital in France, shows a poor correlation between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activity.
"You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when your muscles and joints ache," he explains.
The study was initiated by INSEP, the French National Institute of Sport.
The school's experts are in charge of guiding athletes in preparing for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, which causes uncontrollable tiredness after strenuous exercise, unable to recover, and failing grades.
INSEP raises the question: Is nerve fatigue partly to blame for this malady, the kind of nerve fatigue resulting from excessive mental effort?
The study appears in the journal Current Biology.

According to statistics, since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), we have organized more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, and safely evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and unstable areas.
To handle and coordinate the handling of about half a million requests for help, involving nearly one million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, your motherland can take you home, and it is no longer a dream to take a "walk-away" trip.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa abolition agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel, according to Cui.
Moreover, more and more countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens visa-free access or visa-on-arrival facilities.
Thailand, Egypt and 42 other countries and regions have unilaterally granted visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports for landing, while 15 other countries and regions, including Indonesia, have unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to enter the country without signing.
In addition to the visa-free, landing and other arrangements, Chinese citizens to apply for visas is also increasingly convenient and simplified procedures.
By the end of August, China had concluded agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include a 10-year multiple visa agreement with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina, a two-year multiple visa arrangement with the United Kingdom for each other's tourism, business and family visits.
Britain and Belgium have jointly introduced a one-stop visa service, with France, Italy and Singapore shortening the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, multi-entry, convenient customs clearance of APEC business travel cards is a good choice.
According to Mr Cui, holding the card is equivalent to getting multiple five-year visas from 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, meaningful for business people, especially private enterprises.
At present, China ranks first among the APEC economies in terms of effective card-holding.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively discuss bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, and translate diplomatic achievements into measures to benefit the people and the people, thus enhancing the "gold content" of Chinese passports.

After being held by Iran for two months, the British oil tanker Stener was released and set sail from the Iranian port of Abbas for international waters on the 27th morning.
Just in the middle of last month, authorities in Gibraltar, the British overseas territory, released an Iranian oil tanker that had been in custody for more than a month.
At 9 a.m. local time, the British oil tanker "Stanna Empire" departed from the port of Bandar Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf, according to the Iranian news agency.
The Ports and Maritime Organization of the Iranian province of Hormuzgan confirmed that the ship's commanders and crew had made formal and written commitments and, although the ship was seized, they had no claims.
Stein<unk>k, the Swedish owner of the Stanna Empire oil tanker, also said the ship was sailing from the port of Bandar Abbas.
Infinit Infiniti's ship tracking data also revealed that the tanker began moving on the 27th and left the port of Abbas.
The steamer, flying the British flag, was seized by Iran in July.
A spokesman for the company said the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained it in the Strait of Hormuz waterway.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, an Iranian government spokesman said all the legal procedures required for the release of the Stener empire had been completed.
But Iran says the investigation is still under way.
Iranian media have also released video of the launch of an oil tanker.

Wu Lan, deputy secretary of the provincial Party committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), stressed that political positions should be raised and political responsibility strengthened.
Ulan fully affirms the initial results of the second batch of thematic education in undergraduate colleges and universities.
She pointed out that carrying out education on the theme of "Remembering the Beginning and Bearing in mind the Mission" was an important arrangement made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
From the political height of strengthening the "four consciousnesses", achieving the "two safeguards" and fulfilling the original mission, we will conscientiously carry out all kinds of activities related to the subject-oriented education, in particular the series of issues examined and overhauled in a down-to-earth way, and make overall plans for all aspects of school reform and development, so as to achieve "two wrongs and two promotions".
Ulan stressed that we should stick to the blades of the knives inwards, examine the problems properly, and, in accordance with the requirement of "four contrasts" and "four seek ways to find out the correctness of the standards," seek advice from teachers and students, parents and people from all walks of life on a wide-ranging basis, dissect and profoundly root causes ideologically, and then clarify the direction of our efforts and measures to improve them, so as to come up with practical solutions to the difficult problems.
Want to insist on accurate hair force, strengthen true to change reform, practically " change" the word runs through all the time.
We should do a good job of combining the thematic education with the work of "Lide Shuren" and so on, compacting the responsibilities for rectification, ensuring that problems remain unresolved, see bottom to bottom, and strive to improve the effectiveness of the rectification.
We must adhere to the principle of treating both specimens and specimens, improve the long-term mechanism, weave tightly and fasten cages, strengthen the rigidity of the system, and ensure that all work is done in a well-regulated and well-regulated way.
Leading cadres should take the lead in strengthening the theoretical armed forces, taking the lead in examining rectification and taking the lead in strict self-discipline, giving play to the exemplary role of "critical minorities" and striving to fulfill the tasks of reviewing and reforming the subject-matter education.
Five college Party committees in charge of Hunan University and other colleges and universities made statements.
"One intersection has been" two major high-voltage projects commissioned
On June 26, the quasi-east to southern Anhui ±1100 kV DC transmission project, Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL integrated pipe corridor project commissioned.
These two projects both occupy the high point in the current world transmission technology, which will greatly improve China's large-scale optimization of energy allocation.
Guo Zhi, chief economist at the State Energy Administration, said the quasi-east-to-south Anhui project was the world's largest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL, gaseous insulated metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong Pipeline Corridor Project has set a record of the highest voltage level and the strongest conveying capacity of the GIL project in the world, thus realizing the operation of the double-loop AC network with the highest voltage level of the backbone network in eastern China.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the transmission distance of the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is as long as 3324 kilometers.
Using conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electricity consumed will be lost on the way, and the project has been developed to increase the economic conveying distance substantially to more than 3,000 kilometres.
When the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is put into operation, 100 million degrees of electricity can be transmitted every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help to solve the problem of absorption of new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, this line alone will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours a year, which will provide more than half of the city's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipe corridor project is a control project of UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
Using conventional overhead lines across the Yangtze River requires the erection of two super 450-metre-tall iron towers and the construction of an artificial island the size of a soccer field for each tower.
To this end, the State Grid bold innovation, developed a compact ultra-high-voltage AC GIL transmission technology, through tunnels from underwater rivers, to avoid the impact on the gold channel.
The two projects have promoted our electrical equipment manufacturing capability to achieve a new leap.
At present, the State Grid has completed a cumulative "10 AC 11 DC" ultra-high-voltage project, and "4 AC 3 DC" is under construction.

Taiwanese Scholars Say: " Uncertain Age " Taiwanese Businessmen Need to Keep Up with Mainland Industries
"Taiwan Business Innovation Mode Forum" held in Taipei on the 26th and 27th consecutive two days.
The event invited representatives of Taiwanese businessmen and scholars to share their experience on corporate transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
This forum is sponsored by Taipei Management Research Institute, Group Yijin Ding Securities, outstanding Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce and other organizations co-organized.
The two-day conference was divided into upgrading and upgrading modes, operational strategies and other seminars, attended by more than 100 participants.
Chen Mingzhang, dean of the Taipei Business Management Research Institute, said that Sino-US trade frictions persisted and Taiwanese businessmen faced “uncertain times”.
He believes that Taiwanese businessmen need to keep up with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries in the mainland, with special attention to innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism and health.
"Taiwan businessmen used to value quality, effectiveness and delivery. "
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above-mentioned conditions are not enough for Taiwanese traders at present.
He pointed out that Taiwanese-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to the extension of services and life products services.
In addition, "service appreciation" is also a new area that Taiwanese businessmen can develop vigorously.
Mr Hui Wentang, chairman of Anesthetic Electronics Ltd., a Taiwanese merchant from Guangdong, said that Anesthetic Electronics had been experiencing operational difficulties as a result of a sharp reduction in orders.
Taking away the traditional electrical appliances business, transforming the electrical equipment for vehicles, and entering the intelligent home appliances industry, it took three years for the enterprise to achieve revenue.
Bai Hongzhang, general manager of Sunshen (Zhuhai) Electronics Co. , Ltd. , argued that if developing new customers was difficult, it would be better to focus on the original customers to provide "one-stop" service.
Customers can replace suppliers with other factors such as poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, fewer varieties and integrity. As long as these six factors are solved, together with timely transformation of the production line and expansion of the product line, enterprises will become irreplaceable suppliers to customers.

Obtaining Opinions on the New Regulation: Social Capital Needs Qualification to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
Social Capital Needs Qualifications to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
"Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" to solicit opinions publicly
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (the Draft Amendments) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Opinions), adding to the supervision and risk prevention of such social capital transfer as industrial and commercial enterprises.
The draft Opinions are now open to the public for comment.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas said that in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural land management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of separation of powers, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas amended the Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracted Management Rights and formed the Draft of Opinions.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters understand that the first published "Views" a number of important revisions.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting clearly defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three powers divided," and sets up the "right to contract and manage land" separately in special sections, making a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of the right to manage the land contracted and the right to manage the land (lease, subcontract, share, or other forms).
In the draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of separation of powers, effectively respond to the main thrust of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and to take into account the great differences between parties, procedures and supervision on the transfer of land management rights and the transfer of land management rights, the revised draft focuses on the transfer of land management rights, including the transfer of lease and shares, and changes the title of the regulation from the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracted Management Rights to the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights.
The transfer and exchange of land contracted management rights will be regulated separately.
The draft opinion points out that under the background of "three powers divided" , only a certain period of land management rights are allowed for farmers to take equity stakes.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, there is only a risk that the farmers will lose the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is no longer legally necessary to return the contracted land to the original contractor and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent farmers from losing their land, preferred shares, leased shares and bought back shares have been produced in practice.
Considering that preferred stock has been discussed theoretically in the company law, it is suggested that it be regarded as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of shares.
