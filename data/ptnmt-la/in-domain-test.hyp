On September 24, more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star Ferry of Orange Island to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who took part in the event were on a cruise for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a crippled man who rarely travels because of his inability to move his feet.
He said, "It is exciting and unforgettable to travel on a cruise for the first time today, to see the magnificence of the Xiangjiang River from a distance and to feel the pulse of Changsha's development.

As the republic celebrates its seventieth anniversary, the spotlights of all media outlets flash with images that we normally don't remember. It is they who bring heat and light to our shining days
However, if the hero walks around, also seems ordinary as you as I.
Yuan Longping devoted himself to rice research and produced excellent seeds to cultivate all over the world, so that more than a billion people in China would not be famished. He is also like an old peasant who likes to stroll in the fields.
They live simply, purely and persistently, and are easy to be cheerful, regardless of fame or wealth, if they are immersed in a business that foreigners do not understand and which they value highly.
As in Jin Yong's novel, the sweeper monk in the Shaolin Temple's Buddhist scripture hall, though embracing martial arts, is neither dazzling nor reserved, neither happy nor sad.
Every "sweeping monk" , every pair of bare-hearted hearts, there is a homeland who gave me to bear.
Home and country bear, not only in the shoulders of heroes, but also hold in the palms of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, a girl high school student's words, by netizens crazy turn, "When the heroes passing, there will always be people sitting by the roadside applause ... I do not want to be a hero, I want to be the people sitting by the roadside applause.
In fact, when the hero and give the hero applause, is not contradictory.
The one who applauds by the roadside also transmits heat and light, and he himself is a luminous being.
Ordinary as you and I, life always has some opportunities, some moments, there is a cumulative, but also in the shape of heroic appearance.
Zhou Bihua, an outstanding judge in Shanghai, has been charged with the task of judicial reform, but at the annual conference, he was asked to tell his story by an old master of the communication room.
It's a show of pity between heroes. One hero applauds the other.
The sweeping monk has the Sutra Pavilion of the Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanrendong has the "eye of heaven", Qin Yi has the stage, and Zhou Ruchang has the rostrum It is not only up to him to be a hero, but also he must have a good environment and positive motivation mechanism.
For example, the "Chinese Heavenly Eye", now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Tsi-shing had not yet begun to write Three Styles.
The bull's "eye" at the time was the 350-metre diameter Arecibo, a single-sided aperture radio telescope in the valley of the American island of Puerto Rico, considered "unsurmountable" in the world.
At that time, China's radio telescopes, less than one tenth of the diameter of others.
But Nan, who enjoys world - class scientific conditions and salaries, insists on returning with a near - mad idea: building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space.
China is awaiting rejuvenation, investing heavily to play with the stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong and the "sky-eye" project begins happily.
It took 12 years to select the site and another nine to complete it.
With the opening of the 500-metre-diameter Eye of Heaven, China has accomplished an unprecedented, "unparalleled scientific project in the world".
Thus, the "eye of heaven" is great, the Nanrendongs are great, and the Republic is great, standing in the distance.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have the chance to become the soul of the country and the liver of the people.
There are young talented, white-haired heroes graciously walked, there are people in the roadside gently applauded, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.

Chirac dies, political heritage endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac has died at the age of 86.
At a time of unprecedented upheaval in the world, the French statesman's political legacy is still worthy of praise.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a highly charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the diplomatic spirit of De Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration.
At the same time, he advocated world multi-polarization and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of the statesman.
That is why the French media have described him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's fondest political decisions was to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to overcome the pressure of the United States, in the front ranks of anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would exacerbate terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Subsequently, Mr Chirac's warnings proved correct.
At a time when European integration is at a loss and U. S. unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, looking back to the past, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and kind.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the "Golden Decade" in China-France relations.After his first election to the presidency of France in 1995, he pushed for the rapid development of China-France relations from a statesman's strategic perspective.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges have entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, the bilateral trade volume of China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields made breakthrough progress.
The Sino-French Cultural Year initiated by Chirac has created a brand-new mode of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong devotion to Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can recite poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately date the history of Chinese bronze ware.
It's not true to have been to Egypt without looking at the pyramids, it's not true to have been to China without looking at the terra cotta warriors.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "Western countries have concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political status in the world.
But I personally have confidence in China.
"I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it build its concepts and values of harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come," he said.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich it.
The Sri Lankans are gone, but the political legacy and revelations that Chirac left behind will endure.

Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council Members join hands to oppose US legislation on Hong Kong
Some members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Legislative Council (LegCo) expressed strong opposition to the passage of the "Human Rights and Democracy Bill in Hong Kong, 2019." in a joint statement.
According to the statement, which was jointly signed by 40 members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Hong Kong's rights under the Basic Law are currently vested in the HKSAR.They include maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, conducting trade, cooperation and development with different countries and regions of the world in different fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements under the name of "Hong Kong, China".
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics, and participated in various areas of cooperation with other countries and regions.
The statement said the move by the House and Senate Foreign Committees to pass the bill was unnecessary and 'in response to its call to harm Hong Kong agents as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and for its agents to gain political leverage in Hong Kong.
Constitutional MPs expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner of the United States and the source of its largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the US passes this bill, it will not only hurt Hong Kong and its own interests, but also aggravate China-US relations.
The statement said Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations effectively.
In the past, present and future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade.
France's parliament and parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported Tuesday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently claimed that France was unable to "take in all", but was trying to "take in well".
The report says Mr. MacLean is trying to find a compromise on immigration matters to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview during the U.S. General Assembly's general debate in New York, Mr. MacDonald said he wanted a genuine "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"If France wants to be able to accommodate properly [immigrants], it cannot accommodate everyone, " he said.
He outlined four priorities for immigration policy: the expeditious granting of asylum to refugees in need of protection; more efficient promotion of integration; the reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of persons who had illegally entered France and were unfit to remain.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion.
He said he hoped to be able to "evaluate" the system, but not to abolish it, but to limit it.
Following his remarks, the leader of the far-right National League, Mario Le Pen, tweeted that his statement was "empty talk".
Senate Speaker Lindsey Lasher, a right-wing Republican, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "relaxed" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Mr. McClellan.
On immigration, Mr Varo, a leftist Socialist MP, said France should be "more receptive and better" and criticised Mr Marceau for "manipulating" the issue.
A year after its enactment, the new asylum and immigration law has divided the ruling party but failed to placate the right-wing opposition, the report said.
In the next 2022 election, when immigration policy will once again be the focus of extreme right-wing attacks, Mr. McClellan needs to do something about it, but at the risk of provoking left-wingers within the ruling party.
It is reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are on the wave of buybacks, with many listed companies offering genuine gold and silver to buy back shares.
The total amount of repurchase funds for A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB), a record high, according to financial data service provider Orient Wealth.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Michael Rong Information Consultancy Co., said the overall valuation of A-share market was low this year and buying back shares at a relatively low price was conducive to improving the efficiency of capital use by listed companies, reflecting the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow, which was conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
Earlier this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules on the implementation of share repurchase by listed companies, providing them with detailed rules and guidelines on share repurchase.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan so far this year are mainly concentrated in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing industries.
In addition, from the repurchase payments, this year, six listed companies repurchase more than 1 billion yuan.
Among them, in the top spot was Eli shares, with a buyback value of more than $5bn.
What effect will listed companies'repurchase of shares have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice-dean of the Faculty of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, told China News Agency reporters that the buy-backs show that listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial status, ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence, on the other hand, listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and investors responsible considerations.
The former is based on the good performance of the company while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For the capital market, these are the most core of the basic elements.
The stock repurchase of listed companies is conducive to boosting investors' confidence and supporting the stock price of listed companies.
According to the calculation of Oriental Securities Research Institute, according to the total number of A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average price of the transactions of the stocks repurchased, this year's stock repurchase for the A-share market is expected to bring incremental funds exceeding 15 billion yuan.

Shandong original Shouguang county secretary Wang Boxiang - Qiang County rich people Chizi Xin - Xinhua
Born in February 1943, Wang Boxiang, a native of Shouguang, Shandong Province, joined the Communist Party in 1967 and successively held posts as Party secretary of townships, county secretary and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed secretary of Shouguang county council in Shandong province, where Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five years in office, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing the salt-and-alkali beaches in Shouguang North; and laying the foundation for an industrial renaissance that would enable Shouguang people to fill their pockets and straighten their backs.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but also have a lesson of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers harvested a bumper crop of vegetables that failed to sell and rotted in the fields.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasp vegetables is to do a good circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in establishing wholesale vegetable market and opened the prelude to the development of market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead. If they fail, the county will bear all the losses.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhu Village, set up 17 winter-heated vegetable stalls.
Then the county set up a promotion team, in Wang Boxiang's mobilization, Wang Leyi in each township guided the tour; the first year on the promotion of more than 5,000 vegetable shed, after the vegetable shed like a prairie fire to the county and even the nation.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 1.6 million acres of land in addition to salt and alkaline beaches, is a shallow beach coating.
The local people live a hard life.
Shoushou Nan has vegetable shed, Shoushou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized more than 100,000 people to conduct a general war, camped in the deserted alkaline beach, a dry forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres of the county ate and slept on the construction site, carrying burdens like migrant workers, feasting and sleeping in the open air.When the people saw them, they all held out their thumbs and admired them in their hearts Shoubei had developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields and 600,000 acres of cotton fields.
In July 1986, Wang attended the Weifang City Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county council.
During the meeting, a comparative table of industrial economic figures in twelve counties of Weifang was issued.At first glance, the industrial output value was not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value is only 1.19 billion yuan, the bottom three.
Wang Boxiang, with a group of more than 70 scholars, went abroad to "change their minds" .
Within a year of its return, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, we have organized annual <unk>淪tudying Missions<unk>?to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai for the study of Buddhism.
Shouguang lacks enterprises, even less entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a special meeting to set the tone: in the county open selection of directors and managers, 40 "ambitious people" to stand out and be promoted to the industrial front.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang Vice Mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 vegetable stalls, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 ten thousand ten thousand households, the cadres approved by the people.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi presides over the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African member states of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 26.
Current African Security Council member, Foreign Minister of Ce d'Ivoire, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister of South Africa, Foreign Minister Pandol, Foreign Minister of Niger, Foreign Minister of Tunisia and other appointees attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, strength comes from unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations is undermined, to the detriment of the interests of developing countries, small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder.
In the Security Council, three African nations speak with one voice, and the focus is not just on three votes, but the continent as a whole.
Together with Africa, China will not merely have four votes, but will lead other countries to follow up, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, and we should make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, settle disputes by negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly in Africa's hot spots, are largely rooted in colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
We should jointly make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and play the role of good offices and mediation of the UN.
Third, we should strive for self-improvement by ourselves.
African countries and people know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with African hotspot issues, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and resolutely push forward the capacity-building of African independent peace operations.
Fourth, development is fundamental.
China and the African countries are developing countries.We should put economic and social development first and mutually support each other's choice of development path.
China is ready to work closely with the African Union on its Agenda 2063, the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development for 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
We should jointly push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
China has made and will continue to do its utmost to provide human and material assistance within its capabilities in the wake of the re-emergence of the Ebola epidemic in Congo (Kim), and is ready to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations and WHO, so as to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (Kim).

Trudeo collapsed, will he be able to succeed in re-election
This time Trudeo tripped out of the "big pit" , it was Trudeo himself who dug it a little.
Recently, Canadian media revealed a series of old photographs of incumbent Prime Minister Trudeau, Trudeau will be disguised as a black image.
It was considered a clear act of racial discrimination and caused a stir in Canada.
Trudeo repeatedly apologized to the public after the incident.
Canadians, however, are not buying it.
Trudo lifted the stone and threw it at his own feet.
As political commentators such as Riley have pointed out, since the rise of the Anti-Blackface Movement in the United States, Trudew and the Federal Liberal Party have high-profilely accused the opposition or dissidents within their own party of "being guilty" of "great misconduct" in this regard and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits this mistake should be expelled immediately".
To put it simply, it was Trudo himself who dug the big hole that tripped him out.
A handsome young man, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau made his debut with a whirlwind of political icons.
Originally a statesman, he took over as head of the Liberal Party and fought an unprecedentedly good fight in federal parliamentary elections in 2015, when the Liberal Party won a valuable seat in the lower house and a separate cabinet.
At that time, Trudeau proposed many revolutionary policies and concepts, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "corruption winds".
For five years, however, he has been "walking up and down" in almost all of these areas.
Ethnic and gender equality issues aside, the Blackface incident follows a series of rhetoric on indigenous issues that led indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to the Capitol gates on Canada's 150th anniversary.
On the fight against corruption, Mr Trudo was involved in the "Lan Wan Ling incident" late last year and early this year.
It was revealed that his hometown's construction and engineering company "Lan Wanling" major violations and malpractices, to investigate and punish the departments and officials in charge of pressure, the latter "high-handed".
Furthermore, Trudeau turned on the disclosure official, Chaudi Wang, who was the first Canadian prosecutor-general to directly handle cases when he first revealed the corruption.
Although the case itself is still suspicious, but its suspicion is difficult to wash.
Many observers point out that the collapse of the government in the past five years was largely the result of digging holes in the country's economy, the biggest of which are the tiger's tail, snake's tail, and snake's tail.
Statistics from Canada's most authoritative Angus Reid poll show that since 2015, respondents in favour of Trudo have slid from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opposition has soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Despite similarly poor performances by other opposition parties and their leader, even a sizeable minority of voters still willing to vote for the Liberals are now turning their backs on the federal prime minister, who heads the ruling party.
With a new federal legislative election due to begin on October 21st, will Trudeau be able to repeat his winning streak of five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Both from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei development, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened.
The opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capability of Beijing's air services, Xinjing Daily reported from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission.
Following Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China with two airports.It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international aviation.In the future, the Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also serve different domestic and international aviation businesses by differentiating their locations and providing more detailed services.
Daxing airport traffic, from the point of view of business development, for the capital airport is more favorable impact.
Capital Airport handled more than 100 million passengers in 2018, ranking first in the country.However, compared with the fast-growing business demand, there is still a significant shortage of capacity, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism and business trips, and to meet the development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected city, Daxing International Airport has been positioned as a large international hub airport, with a projected annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and freight and mail throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports do not overlap positioning, respectively targeting different customer groups, there is also sufficient market space.
From an economic point of view, Daxing International Airport's traffic, will obviously form a win-win effect, ease the tension in Beijing's air transport capacity, speed up passenger and cargo throughput growth rate, capital aviation double-core operation of the incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, passengers will not have to travel in the capital airport in the future, but they will also be able to reduce a series of problems caused by the over-concentration of flight routes, such as the longer safeguard time, slower passenger boarding speed, indirectly increasing the aircraft and passengers in the airport stay time, increasing the burden of airport operation, and reducing the load through the capital airport, in fact improving passengers' travel experience.
According to the media's estimates of the time and cost of various transportation routes to the large international airport, such as taking the Beijing Expressway from the southern Wuhuan to directly go to the Daxing Airport Expressway, which can be reached in 50 minutes by car, about 40 yuan for fuel and 15 yuan for highway fare.
Generally speaking, the public have a variety of means of transportation to Daxing Airport, the cost and time are also in a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing Airport is located as a transportation hub between Beijing and Tianjin, so it is a little far away from Beijing, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing International Airport.
Daxing Airport's transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to Beijing directly to Daxing Airport's new airport line, there are many highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the expressways of Guangzhou Guangfu and Guangzhou Shenzhen, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an New Area around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport to obtain convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen from this that the opening of Daxing International Airport has not only added a few runways and a few aircraft, but also has far-reaching impact and positive significance in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and development integration of Beijing, not only concerns the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, provides diversified choices for the travel of the residents of Beijing, Tianjin and Jiangxi, and promotes the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing's shipping industry, is more conducive to promoting the integration process of Beijing, Tianjin and Jiangxi, and stimulates the economic and trade development around Daxing International Airport.
Therefore, for Daxing airport's navigation, we need to calculate not only individual small accounts, but also the overall development accounts.

2009 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum to be held in Chentianshunhua Prefecture
Nguyen Dungan, deputy director of Vietnam's parliamentary economic committee, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new developments and continued to maintain the growth trend.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019. proposing measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019. and by 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four topics, namely, the economic development in 2020 and the impact of some of the FTAs, some outstanding issues in the economy of Viet Nam in 2020, outstanding issues in the social culture of Viet Nam in 2020 and forecasts and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020.
Representatives generally agreed that global growth would slow in the first months of 2019. with increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has confirmed that despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, with 70 per cent of the world's economies in stagnation, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many encouraging results.
GDP grew by 6.66 percent in the first half of 2011, down from 7.05 percent in the same period last year, but still a relatively high rate compared with the same period in 2011-2012.
Deng Deying, deputy director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecasting Center, said the country's economy would show high growth in 2020 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will remain basically stable, the implementation of various self-trade agreements will boost trade development, economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Vietnam's export activities will be declining due to trade frictions.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, seek opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, we will keep the inflation rate at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improving global economic governance and promoting common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world's second-largest economy, China has contributed more than 30 percent to world economic growth, Liu said.In particular, with China's <unk>淪hanghai-Pacific Economic Cooperation<unk>?project, cooperation between local provinces and cities in Siam and other provinces in the region has been steadily deepening.
He said this year marks the opening of 61 years of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia.The two countries enjoy fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force for economic and social development in the region.
Siam Governor Siamese highly praised the great achievements of New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
He hoped the two sides would continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
Siam has so far concluded friendly city relations with 28 provinces and municipalities in China, with major cultural performances such as Angkor's Smile and Angkor's Dynasty, the Siam-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siam New International Airport Project, a special training program for Siam government officials, scholarships for Siam students to study in China, rural volunteer clinics, the construction and renovation of urban roads, and the Cataract Rehabilitation Public Welfare Project Bright Line.

Witness the Rise of Digital China in Yunqi Township - Xinhua News Agency
If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou held in the 2019. Cloud Habitat Conference has been a full decade.
From the concept of "mist in the cloud" to the practice of "up to the cloud", large-scale data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services in the past decade.
At Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, recent inspectors were surrounded by new 'colleagues' equipped with Ali Yun's artificial intelligence.
Its 24-hour continuous, recognition speed is more than twice the artificial, quality inspection accuracy is stable in more than 95%.
The camera-equipped inspector has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 flaw samples, and with cloud computing power behind him, he can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and sort out defective batteries, according to the company's director.
The company is just an epitome of today's cloud computing that has helped transform manufacturing.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MII) issued the Guidance Note on Promoting Enterprises to Go to the Cloud ( 2018-2020) in 2018, proposing that by 2020, it will strive to raise enterprises' consciousness and enthusiasm to go to the cloud, and the proportion of enterprises to go to the cloud as well as the depth of its application.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has paved the way for a digital economy where data is a key factor, says Wang Jian, founder of Ali Cloud.
Meanwhile, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has been expanding in the past decade.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (1995) released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.92 percent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology supporting industrial transformation and digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Cloud Habitat Congress, the "urban brain" still attracts attention for three consecutive years.
Ali said the city's brain has evolved from a transportation management tool into a hub for city management, and cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the city's brain's powerful computing capabilities, new city management services such as "park first, pay later" "consultants real-time perception" "travel route design" have been implemented.
In the field of government affairs service, cloud computing brings convenience to both sides of the supply of government affairs service.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform in the whole province through government affairs cloud.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million legal entities in the province, bringing together 1.98 billion data in 3066 categories.
Zhejiang Province, the average monthly inter-departmental data transfer, shared 12 million times, data flow on the 'cloud' every time more, may mean that the masses less run errands.
Be careful with plastic tea bags!
A bag of plastic tea bags could release billions or even hundreds of billions of plastic particles, a new Canadian study has found, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of the microscopic plastic, but so far there is no evidence that ingestion poses a threat, the Central News Agency reported.
Researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reported that by dipping the bag into a glass of nearly boiling hot water at 95 degrees Celsius, it released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake of micro-plastics.
According to research published earlier this year, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount.
The researchers, who reported in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags at Montreal stores and cafes, opened them, rinsed them and immersed them in nearly boiling water for five minutes before analysing them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several rungs higher than the previous plastic load on other foodstuffs".
Most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands that use natural fibres still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some branded tea bags have switched from paper to plastic, and these were the ones the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define as between 100 nanometres and 5 centimetres in size and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest seas around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human excrement samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released in tea bags, the Canadian team placed water fleas in contaminated water and found that the microscopic plastics affected their behaviour and deformed their development.
According to the World Health Organization, there is so far no evidence that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impacts they have on humans.
The researchers speculated that the bags released large quantities of plastic particles because they came in contact with boiling water and could break down or leak toxic substances even if the " edible-grade" plastic was heated above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres says climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster can erode the achievements of a generation of development.
The devastation of hurricanes hitting Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas this year illustrates this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at altitudes of five metres or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their society and way of life, and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's climate action summit, small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction by committing themselves to achieving carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is piling new injustices onto the old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States have contributed little to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also mired in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for finding ways to assist small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-adaptive infrastructure and in their transition to renewable sources of energy, and for international agencies to assist small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, in obtaining financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the lifeline of the planet, the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, some extreme sealevel rise that would have occurred only once a century is likely to occur every year in many regions.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals. In the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
Demands from industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States are also faced with high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets to keep them hostage to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons and examples for the world to learn from."
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is fully liquid.
India's economic growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this fiscal year, driven by festive consumer demand and ample liquidity in the financial system, Finance Minister Manmohan Sitambaram said Tuesday.
Mr. Sitaraman made the remarks after meetings with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitaraman did not specify where the remarks were aimed.
Some Indian and overseas media have previously blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for the continued slowdown in India's economy.
Taking the decline in auto sales as an example, Mr. Sitaraman denies that liquidity constraints are the main cause of the decline.
The decline in auto sales is largely due to cyclical factors, Mr. Sitaraman said.
India's economic growth is likely to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending, Mr. Sitaram predicts.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and runs until the end of the year.
Shopping is expected to boost India's economic growth significantly.

Support pig production and ensure market supply
Sui loyalty request from six aspects to grasp the implementation of various measures
A teleconference was held today to mobilize and redeploy the policies and measures of the Central Government, provincial and provincial governments to support pig production and ensure market supply.
Sui loyalty requirements from six aspects to grasp pig production measures to implement.
The mayoral responsibility system for "the vegetable basket" has been well implemented.This year, the specific task of raising 45 million pigs in the whole province has been decomposed into municipalities and prefectures and incorporated into the accountability system.
We will do a good job in implementing various policies and measures and solve the problem of "the last kilometer" of policy implementation.
We will ensure that the production of breeding sows is well carried out, that the subsidized policies for breeding sows with good breeds are conscientiously implemented, and that pig breeding enterprises are encouraged to expand the breeding scale of breeding sows, and that good sows are selected from the commercial pig population in a planned way.
We should do a good job in carrying out the investment invitation and take the famous large-scale aquaculture enterprises which have not yet entered our province as the top priority.
We will work hard to implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for pigs, and comprehensively promote the transformation from "swine-mixing" to "meat-mixing".
In order to implement the modern epidemic prevention system well, all localities should have grass-roots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel suited to the breeding scale and tasks, and build up the first line of epidemic prevention and control.
Sui loyalty demands that all efforts be made to ensure the meat market supply, to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage, large-scale supply cut-off, to ensure that major holidays supply of pork market stability.
The meeting also deployed such tasks as preventing and controlling African swine plague, banning and withdrawing fishing from important waters of the Yangtze River valley and buying rice in the middle and late of the year.

<unk>here are some sites where over-age migrant workers are estimated to account for more than half.<unk>?
Where can I find young workers now?
Nor do they want to use so many 'old people' on the site. There's nothing we can do."
Recently, there are many over-aged migrant workers on the site (over the retirement age), long-time construction contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's university carrying out rain and sewage diversion project, there are a lot of migrant workers on campus, if you look carefully, you will find there are many over-aged migrant workers.
It is not that over-aged migrant workers cannot stay idle, but that the helplessness and hardship of having to - whether saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or helping their children - drive these old people to continue working hard, which should be idle.
It is not as easy as we thought for the over-aged migrant workers to have their old relatives.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing for children to read, helping children to build houses and buy cars, helping children to start a family and raise their grandchildren, when these migrant workers have completed their "duties of life", their moneybags have been emptied and even many debts, most of them lack the accumulation of wealth.
In order not to drag their children and in order to accumulate more fortunes for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing their jobs until they can't do them any more".
Many new generations of migrant workers in the "80s", "90s" and even "00s" are reluctant to work in hard-pressed, high-intensity secondary industries or in low-end service industries, resulting in a structural labor shortage.
Due to the lack of skills, physical function and labor capacity decline, many over-aged migrant workers are working in jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and low security.
Being able to work day by day and earn more money, the surviving predicament of over-aged migrant workers behind "cannot idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid wages and salary claim, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income and improve the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers, in addition to their "self-saving", it is equally inseparable from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-aged migrant workers are unlikely to rely on farming at home to solve their old-age and medical problems.
Understanding the helplessness and strongness of over-aged migrant workers, which can help us better understand the love and pain of over-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs and trying to get them to return to the countryside, it is necessary for the public sector, the market and society to share their responsibilities in a healthy interaction.
He said Russia would not export the system for the next five years because "it will first supply its troops and then export production".
This is in full conformity with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, the deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's space force, General Yuri Grehhoff, said work on developing the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system is developed by the Diamond-Antai Air Defense Co. Ltd.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft system, using the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range less than 3500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy supersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, supersonic missiles more than five times the speed of sound, and even targets in outer space.
The weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence point of view.
Sergei Chemedov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in operation with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
The refurbishment of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Isle Arctic Air Defense Corps has been completed, according to news on Sept. 15.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defence ministry says this is entirely strategically oriented north to more advanced defensive tools in the process of transition plan.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has significantly expanded," the Russian Northern Fleet News Agency said.
Very importantly, the military has assessed the successful use of the system in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air Defense Corps officers and men have been trained for the new system, and ready to enter the combat duty.
It was previously equipped with the S-300 long-range anti-aircraft system, which is still partly preserved.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of aerial targets, be they high-speed targets flying at high altitudes or "fish out of a net" approaching protected installations.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by King Diamond-Antai Air Defense Co., is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, supersonic targets and other aerial assault weapons.
The weapon can attack an aerodynamic target within 400 kilometers and shoot down a ballistic target that flies 4. 8 kilometers per second within 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the polar north to ensure airspace security on the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor (Tor)-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to Russia’s Arctic, enough to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the Arctic’s air defence system.
Russia's defence ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Tol" troops in the future will be expanded to the full brigade-level system.
With the new S-400 long-range systems deployed on New Isle and the Kola Peninsula, and the Pantsir- SA short-range systems deployed in the Arctic North, these advanced air defense weapons are powerful in defending Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and UAV missiles will be difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods and avoid the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own.
As a Russian grocery store operator the company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
... span class='class1'>China's largest trading platforms include Tianmu, JD, 1688, Pinduduo, ShouQ, Wechat and many other online platforms.
Russia Export Center will work with Russia Pinto jointly to formulate store marketing strategies and participation criteria, and screen virtual shelf products on the shelf enterprises.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and display products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
Russian Export Center data shows that the total monthly visits to China's e-commerce platform up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and exceeded $1bn in 2018.
Alibaba is also opening pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
The store will display goods from companies with sales of at least Rmb500 million or more, according to Alexei Kozyrevnikov.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher. 500 million roubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian goods and see our goods as of high quality and environmentally friendly.
'The competition for Chinese consumers who have a strong purchasing power is fierce and is intensifying, ' he said.
"We have ambitious goals to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years, " he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelf of Russian Far Eastern enterprises products.
"It's a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centres are state-owned, not privately owned," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Department of Trade Policy Basics at Leninov Economic University in Russia.
I don't see a lot of competitive Russian goods on the market.
He said the project is unlikely to be implemented, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Andrew Slepnev, president of Russia's Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian companies' products had been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and could be bought in China or elsewhere, AP reported.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely experts from Taobao University to Russian enterprises training project, its first seminar held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also act as the organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in trade exhibitions and business projects at the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
Large exhibitions will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the centre for business projects, agreement signing ceremonies, introductory meetings and talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
"In addition to the agricultural exhibition, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, direct contacts between entrepreneurs," said the Information Service of the Russian Export Centre.
This is another direction of our effort to support businesses and ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them.
In addition, the Expo will also hold master classes, cooking competitions and "Exploration of Russian cuisine in Shanghai Station" project of the famous Russian chefs cooking Russian American food congress.
Police awaited a full report and instructions from the Attorney-General's Office as they awaited the next step after the coroner's verdict Friday that the death was not accidental.
According to the verdict of the coroner's court, police will await further instructions from the Attorney-General's Office, the National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau said Friday in a statement.
In his statement, he stressed that the police have never terminated the investigation into the death of Mohammed, and the investigation is still in progress.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noah O'Connor said police would await a full report of the ruling before acting.
He responded to questions Friday morning after attending a ceremony at the Sheriff's Department headquarters to hand over the reins of his deputy chief of police.

New China Time Review: Firmly Do Not Take Our Own Road
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the correct way of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to follow it unswervingly.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China follows a development path suited to itself.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness, internal worries and external troubles, generations of benevolence to explore the way to save the country and save the people to seek, go on and on.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system and the presidential system have all been conceived and tried, and none of them have worked".
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a road of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road China has taken is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people, to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and to the common development of China and other countries in the world.
It is only by following the right path that China can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's road of development conforms to China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
Looking back on the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
The Chinese people know the truth of the northern orange, understand that suits others may not suit themselves, only suits their own is the best.
It is with this road-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the miracle that has attracted worldwide attention.
In the tortuous process of human progress, "the end of history" has been famous for a while.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of "the end of history", "the collapse of China" and "the collapse of socialism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries in achieving prosperity, enriching the people and strengthening the country, broadened the way for the developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who want to accelerate their development but also want to maintain their own independence and follow a path suited to their national conditions.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
Rather than <unk>渋nputting<unk>?the foreign model or <unk>渙xporting<unk>?the Chinese model, China will unswervingly follow its own path and realize its own continuous development, and strengthen its relations of governance with other countries so as to make its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance.
The boss of a Foodworks supermarket who fired a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he preferred to hire people of Asian descent was fiercely criticised as “disgraceful”, the Fair Work Commission found.
The commission said that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, who has worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, had treated her employees in an "extremely unfair" manner and that he might have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the commission, conducted an Internet search and found "some job ads that Mr. Wang used to post on various Australian Chinese employment forums".
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Asian preferred lady" and the other "Asian preferred employee".
A third post said he was "more inclined to be overseas" .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text in April, later citing her absence and alleged cash slips ranging from $5.10 to $30 at the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reason for sacking Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
For three years she had been absent from only one shift, and the "loss" amounted to a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal had "actually nothing to do with her conduct or performance".
He said: "In my opinion, supported by the evidence in Mr. Wang's advertisement, the defendant's real motive for dismissing her was that he was more willing to hire staff with Asian backgrounds.
Under article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute an unlawful breach of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of an applicant."
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton, given her "horrific" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker who earns $26 an hour.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Mr Sams said he would submit his findings and documents to the committee's directors to consider whether Mr Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang, he said, did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: "In my view, the Respondent has resorted to a hopelessly unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang "waited" this opportunity, which, in his view, would 'justify' the termination of the employment of the applicant."
"He was wrong ... that the defence, in dismissing the applicant, completely ignored any natural and fair treatment accorded to her and that it was shocking that he should have acted rudely and unfairly in a perfunctory manner."
Although Foodworks is a small business, Mr Sams said, "it must be said candidly that no decent employer will fire employees in the most unfair and perfunctory manner admitted in this case."
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

The world's oldest hairdresser dies at 108 after 96 years of cutting
Anthony Mancinelli, 108, the world's oldest Kim's certified hairdresser, has never retired from daily haircuts for clients, but died of complications from a jaw cancer on Monday, killing his 96-year-old haircut.
He immigrated to the United States at the age of eight and soon cleaned floors in a barbershop. At 12, he began serving customers with scissors as a way to relieve the family's financial burdens, CNN reported.
Mancini went to elementary school but did not graduate.
Mancini's son, Robert, said his father loved work and was loved by people from all over the world, but that although he had always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before he died.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new hairdresser after his father died because he had had his hair cut all his life.
Repurchase of listed companies reached a record high of 100 billion yuan in 2007 - Xinhua News Agency
In order to stabilize the stock price and maintain the image of the company, listed companies have started to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years.Through targeted repurchase and aggregate bidding transactions, they hope to pass the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market, thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investors' confidence.
According to Oriental Wealth Choice, 7.9 billion yuan was used by listed companies to buy back their shares in 2017, which jumped to 510 billion yuan in 2018, and the total amount of A-share buybacks by listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan since 2019.
From the point of view of repurchase purpose, the repurchase of shares and the increase of shareholders seems to be the same, but there are great differences in implementing subject, source of funds, purpose of repurchase and equity of shares.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Michael Rong Information Consulting Co., told the Securities Daily that in November 2018, the Opinion on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares was revised to address problems in the current system such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges issued the Rules for the Implementation of Share Repurchase by Listed Companies.These policies have broadened the sources of funds for share repurchase by listed companies, simplified implementation procedures appropriately, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged listed companies of all kinds to implement equity incentives or employee share-holding schemes.
After the opinion is issued, the operation of share repurchase by listed companies has more applicable situations, simpler repurchase process and more enthusiastic share repurchase.
Buying back shares at a relatively low level also helps listed companies increase the efficiency of capital use, thus increasing earnings per share, raising net asset yield and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
The repurchase of listed companies' shares is more meaningful than the increase of large shareholders' holdings. It also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued share price is the main factor of the listed companies repurchase, the company's share price has not reflected the company's future development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but not blindly to invest, such companies need to pay attention to the financial reports and specific operating conditions.
The large-scale repurchase behavior of listed companies, at least shows the company's development confidence and capital strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for buy-backs by A-share listed companies has also normalized the activity, with data showing that nearly 1,000 companies have done so this year and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the market.
Ping An has bought 5.759 million shares of A-shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company's total share capital, through a centralized bidding exercise.The total amount of funds paid for the purchases, including but not limited to long-term service plans considered by the company's shareholders' meetings, will be used exclusively for the employee-shareholding program, Ping An said in a recent disclosure.
Yili has paid $5,792 million for share repurchase and has recently adjusted the use of its shares to replace the original plan of “purchasing all of its shares as a source of share incentives at a later stage” with “purchasing 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used as a source of share incentives, and the remaining 30.9 million shares will be written off to reduce registered capital”.
Yili shares said the write-off of some of its repurchased shares would help further boost earnings per share and earnings returns for shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a repurchase progress announcement, TCL Group repurchase 3.59 percent of the company's shares, a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
TCL's board office told Securities Daily that the share buybacks would be used for employee ownership schemes, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, constantly improving competitiveness, sustainable and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the protection of investors<unk>?interests, the company plans to repurchase the company<unk> shares with its own funds, self-financing funds and other fund-raising methods, taking into account the performance of the company<unk> shares in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account such factors as the company<unk> operating and financial conditions.
Yang Delong, chief economist at Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, said the repurchase of shares by listed companies, on the one hand, reduces the number of shares in circulation in the market and increases the earnings per share of listed companies.
The repurchase of listed companies in China has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the outstanding shares. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchase, and it is also worth affirming and encouraging.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee, and the four leading men in engineering machinery manufacturing of the Hunan Army, Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, have set a <unk>mall goal<unk>?to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster in three to five years.
To build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster in Changsha is, in the current fashion, to build the "most powerful on the surface" .
As the inland capital city, Changsha shouted this brave words, the bottom line?
Depends on the strength of hegemony leakage.
The four enterprises involved in the dialogue are well-versed in the fields of sky, underground, sea and land: the intelligent light aircraft of mountains and rivers, the concrete conveying pump of CCL, the all-surface crane of Trinity Heavy Industries and the tunnel shield machine of iron and steel construction industries.
There was a time when China had little voice in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
With the development of China's construction machinery industry, Chinese enterprises have been able to acquire, merge and set up factories in a variety of ways.
Among them, leading enterprises in engineering machinery such as Sanyi Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron and Steel Construction Heavy Industries and Shanhe Intelligence have already taken a big lead in terms of output value, market share and sales.
By the camera and move the momentum control.
Xiangjun "Four Golden Gangs" of engineering machinery, is the leader of engineering machinery industry cluster in Changsha, and also the head enterprise of global engineering machinery industry.
In the quagmire of global industry, who can live, and live well, is the hard way to speak.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered from the cold winter, many well-known international engineering machinery manufacturers have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturers in Changsha, as a "cat winter" "winter swimming", pressure, self-breakthrough through the industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only survived, but also strengthened their bones.
Thanks to the star-studded government and enterprises to help.
To develop the advantageous industries, enterprises need not only to be aggressive, but also the government to take an active role.
Changsha's reputation as the capital of engineering machinery lies in the fact that it has gathered the entire industrial chain from the upstream to the downstream, created clusters of related industries, and reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales of enterprises significantly through such measures as optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises intermingled.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building a world-class engineering machinery. Time and tide wait for no man.
Both the government and enterprises, and even the related production, research and business sectors, should seize opportunities, keep up with the trend, set goals and continue to work hard so as to contribute to Hunan's strength in building and manufacturing a strong country.

Qingyang, Gansu Province: Lake sheep packed to "out of poverty. "
The autumn of September paints the Loess Plateau.
Xia Weili, a 58-year-old villager, fills a feeding trough with the last shovelful of hay and watches the white lake goats munch.
It's delicious. Only when you get fat in autumn and winter can you sell it for a good price.
He feeds the sheep a "special nutritious meal" every day, cleans regularly, sterilizes and waits on them with great care, he said.
He had been raising sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work for a co-operative and learned how rough sheep farming used to be.
Xia Weili is a villager of Xia Loachi Village in Yima Town Qingcheng County Qingyang City Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of scattered, poor sheep quality, small out of the column.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poverty-stricken families in the village joined the cooperatives, and everything began to change.
He studied farming all day long, for there was a constant suffocation in his heart.
The shareholders were all poor families who trusted the sheep to the cooperative and counted on him to pay the dividends and sell them at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned to do epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, became the village's few farming "good handle.
The Yimin Farming Professional Co-operative is a standardized co-operative with 16 sheep stalls and nearly 1,400 sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the co-operative society, said that standardized sheep shed inside and outside, there are doors.
"The wool is thick and bacteria-prone, and the sheep cannot stay in hot and humid places.The sheep shelter must be built in a three-sided trench, and a ventilator must be installed to ventilate the heat.
Zou Tao said, in order to prevent the epidemic, sheep shed also need to be sprayed regularly disinfection, to the sheep three to four times in the first quarter of the needle.
In addition to living well, the sheep have to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheat grass, alfalfa, and have a wide enough "playground" to stretch their muscles.
Cooperatives adopt the method of trusteeship and sub-ownership, and guide local farmers to put good-bred lake goats here for unified raising, management and marketing, so as to realize the breeding of good-bred, scientific, standardized and intensive sheep.
Nowadays, 140 poverty-stricken households with sheep shares receive more than 6,000 yuan in annual dividends, and four of them work in cooperatives for poverty-stricken people.
From mountain grazing to precision feeding, from local mating to artificial insemination, from looking at the body and feeling the belly to doing B-ultrasound one by one In Qingyang, Gansu Province, sheep farming is not just a change in feeding patterns.
If market prices are weak, Mr. Zou said, Gansu's leading enterprise, Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., would buy at a market-protected price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general consultant of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., said the company has driven more and more impoverished households to read the Sutra of Sheep by providing loan guarantees, sheep farming supplies, orders for breeding, quotations for acquisition and unified processing and sales services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poverty-stricken families have achieved steady increases in income through grass breeding, seed breeding, scale breeding, slaughter division and market sales.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry interlaced zone, rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale meat sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, raising more than 5 million meat sheep, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million meat sheep slaughtered.
France's finance minister says tax cuts will exceed 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
LONDON (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should follow in the footsteps of its fiscal stimulus to revive ailing economy, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday.
In introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemaire said the ECB's latest monetary easing initiatives created an opportunity for more investment by governments in countries that can afford it.
The ECB cut interest rates to record lows on Sept. 12 and plans to restart borrowing to lower borrowing costs in an attempt to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
<unk> low interest rates will not restore prosperity to Europe, monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient,<unk>?Mr Lemel told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest and it needs to do so now, as soon as possible. Don't wait for things to get worse, " he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
France has already introduced more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, giving a big boost to its economic growth.
And the global economy is losing momentum, with Germany's export-dependent economy taking the brunt.
Mr. Lemaire said the tax burden on French households would be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax breaks.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1bn over a five-year period as corporate taxes are phased down from 33.3% to 25%.

Study: US National Healthy Diet Index Rises modestly but remains challenging
The U.S. government's index of healthy eating has increased modestly from 56 to 58 in 16 years, according to a new study.
But with a full score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
The nation still faces "significant challenges" in its diet.
Researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts, who co-authored the study, said Americans were still eating too much of the foods linked to heart disease, diabetes and obesity, some of the nation's most common health problems.
The study appears in the 24th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on a government health survey of 44, 000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "in spite of significant improvements, significant dietary challenges persist".
The challenges include reducing Americans' intake of saturated foods such as snacks, hot dogs, fattening beef and butter.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats rose from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, above the recommended 10 percent limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet has been a drop in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but it is still too high.
Officials say the amount of added sugar in the diet should be less than 10 percent.
The researchers linked the decrease in sugar consumption to decreased consumption of sweet fizzy drinks, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adults in the United States increased their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains in small amounts.
However, 2016 figures show that these foods still make up less than 5 percent of the daily diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and lower consumption of fruit juices, which led to lower-quality carbohydrates, Zhang said they still accounted for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, much of which came from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on two-year personal health surveys that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government-issued dietary guidelines for Americans recommend adopting a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and protein-rich seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seeds.
The number of people with diabetes almost doubled during the study, to more than seven percent, and the obesity rate increased over the years around 70 percent of U.S. adults today are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Yuan Wenping, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Central Secretariat and minister of the Central Economic Department, led a delegation to attend the forum.
In line with the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was "Docking the EU with Asia: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future".
The forum was held a year after the EU's docking strategy was implemented on two continents.

New record for deepest tunnel shaft in China
Zhongxin News Agency Baoshan, Sept. 27 (Zhang Weiming Xu Zhou Jingbo) after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, Jianda Rui (Li) railway high Ligongshan tunnel shaft 1 completion on the 27th completed excavation, the depth of the tunnel shaft reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, which was created under flooding conditions.
The 34.5 km Tai Rui railway tunnel is located in Yunnan Province. It runs through the mountains from the Jiangxi coast and is the longest single tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 faults and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 meters.Because it covers almost all of the hazardous geology and major risks that may be encountered in tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and it is an important task to increase the working face to realize "long tunnel short strike" and ventilation of railway operation.
The successful excavation of Shaft 1 to the bottom of the tunnel marks the formal entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction.After the underground vehicle yard is excavated and the equipment is replaced, there will be four additional working faces under the tunnel to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
The shafts are all in the granite formation, because there are so many cracks in the granite formation that water cannot be stopped.
Si Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dalian Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the shaft construction, there were many dangerous situations such as mud inrush and collapse.
The maximum in-well water flow is over 300 cubic meters per hour, and at the bottom of the shaft at a depth of over 700 meters, the pressure is equivalent to that of the seabed at 700 meters.
"If we don't pump and drain in time, we'll drown 10 meters an hour. We spend almost 85 percent of our time treating the water and 15 percent digging in," he said.
In order to overcome the problems of vertical joint development, mud inrush, water-rich granite and so on in the surrounding rock of No.1 shaft, the systemic water control measures combined with "exploration, injection and excavation" are adopted to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No.1 Shaft has formed a mechanized pipeline of excavation system, ballast discharge system, suspension system and winch lifting system, which has realized the mechanization of the whole process of drilling, blasting, ballast discharge, mould installation and concrete pouring, thus accelerating the construction schedule.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of day and night construction, the shaft was successfully completed at a depth of 762. 59 meters.
The Dalian-Macao Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Burma International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of <unk>淪hanghai-Pacific Economic Cooperation<unk>?
Upon completion of the project, the travel time between Dali and Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours.This will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promote the economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Is Ma Hua going to run for the conference by - election in Denver?
Ma Hua President Nadi Sri Wei Jiaxiang: " To discuss the Supreme Council of the National Front! "
In the run-up to the national by-election, it is a matter of concern whether FMLN members, Ma Hua, will take up the traditional national seat.
However, after a meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Ma Hua seat should be returned to Ma Hua or replaced by other members of the party.
Speaking to the media after chairing a meeting of the Central Committee of the Ma Hua Communist Party on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Wei said any by-election would be conducted by the National Front in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP), which require a meeting of the National Front's Supreme Council.
The Supreme Council is expected to meet in early October, he said, as the Electoral Commission meets next Monday to finalize the Danish by-election.
Yesterday morning I also met with the president of the National Front, Gbagbo Nasrallah, and we all agreed that the seat must be taken from the hopeful coalition.
"We have agreed to hold a special meeting of the heads of the three parties in early October to determine which of them will take the front," he said.
Asked if FMLN would insist on the traditional seat of the Supreme Council of FMLN, Mr Wei reiterated that as FMLN's President, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must be made in accordance with FMLN's consensus.
"In any by-election, it is not uncommon for people to be willing to go out, for political parties and for some quarter to think they should go out."
"The most important thing is which organizations and political alliances we come from?
"This is the test of the coalition we have been building for many years and we believe that the National Front has stood by some valuable values along the way.
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process. "

A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province is ordered to " patrol the mountains on duty "
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15420 yuan (RMB, the same as below) for damages to ecological resources and environment.
Because the defendant's family was poor, procuratorial organs began to use alternative labor to compensate for ecological restoration costs, thus realizing the organic unification of legal and social effects.
After three months of "voluntary patrolling mountains" and other alternative labor, Zhou Mou has established a deep relationship with wild monkeys and felt guilty about hunting animals, Wang Zhongliang, deputy chief procurator of Baokang County's procuratorate, said on Tuesday.
On June 21, 2008, the procuratorate of Baokang county brought a case of criminal incidental civil public welfare action in the field of ecological resources, which was heard in public and sentenced in court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, suspended for four years, fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $15420 in compensation for damages to ecological resources and environment.
According to the investigation, Zhou began to set up a grid at the cliff in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including gazelle, suede and moose.
Typhoon antelope belongs to the state's second-class endangered wildlife protection, and suede and moose are listed in the "National Directory of Land Wildlife Protection".
During the trial, Zhou Mou confessed to his wrongful facts and acts, and willing to bear incidental civil liabilities.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of the procuratorate of Baokang County, the local village committee, the forestry station and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration expenses: namely, Zhou provided public welfare services to compensate for ecological restoration expenses by carrying out monkey domestication management work in the village's monkey reserve, compulsory mountain patrol and forest protection for one year.
The court endorsed the prosecutor's proposal, agreeing that Zhou's suspension of sentence should be accompanied by an active implementation of the obligation to compensate for ecological restoration costs through alternative labor.
At present, Zhou Mou has been in the monkey sanctuary compulsory labor for 3 months, active mountain patrol, good performance.
In recent years, the procuratorate of Baokang county has integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behaviors in practice, scientifically applied procuratorial suggestions, investigative supervision and litigation supervision to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment by judicial means.
United Nations awards ant forest " Earth Guardian "
In the warm applause and magnificent music, " ant forest" project leader Xu Ti and user representative Shen Junliang walked onto the podium to receive the cup from the host of the 2019. United Nations " Earth Warrior Award.
The ant forest project, which has mobilised hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental action with a small mobile phone program, won the Incentive and Action Award at the 2009 Earth Defenders Awards ceremony in New York City.
The winners were announced a week ago at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi, Kenya, but people attending the ceremony were still thrilled.
" Ant forest is an exciting innovation that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what we can do for the environment," Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ying Er Anoverson told Xinhua News Agency.
It will have a tremendous impact by connecting people and the environment with technology so that each individual can take part in protecting the planet.
Launched by China's Ant Financial Services Group in August 2016 on the PayThruPost platform, ants can grow trees on their mobile phones by saving "green energy" from low-carbon activities such as tracking their daily green trips and paying for utilities online.
For each virtual tree the user creates, the ant forest and its benefactors plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August this year, 500 million ants forest users have reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 1202 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica's president, Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award for his country's environmental efforts, praised the ant forest's contribution, saying it was "impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green action".
JIN Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ant Goldsuit, said the Earth Guardian Award was a recognition of Ant Forest.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, and the honour belongs to all participants.
The ant forest, which has affected 500m people over the past three years, aims to bring a billion people around the world into low-carbon action over the next three years, he said.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how farmers can earn more from green mountains and rivers.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through tree planting, but also through agricultural product development projects, electricity generation platform to help farmers achieve increased income.
The model of public welfare and environmental protection based on digital technology created by ant forest has also been successfully launched and used by other countries for reference.
In June, GCash, the Philippines' largest electronic wallet, launched a Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment by living in low carbon.
GCash, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and environmental NGOs, plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project's start, the spokesman said.
The Earth Defender's Award, the UN's highest award in the environmental field, is presented annually.
Ant forest was awarded for the third consecutive year in a row to China's Green Innovation Project, which won the Encouragement and Action Award, following the project of China's Sehanba Forestry Farm and China's Zhejiang Province's Thousand Villages Demonstration and Ten Thousand Villages Remediation.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economic "result sheet" .
US gross domestic product growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter as a result of sharp declines in private sector investment and exports, according to the second-quarter economic outlook.
Analysts said economic and trade frictions and uncertainty were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the second quarter, on a par with previous revisions, but significantly lower than the 3.1 per cent pace in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
Consumption growth was the main driver of U.S. growth in the second quarter, according to figures.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, rose 4.6 percent in the quarter, driving growth of 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter, while net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Private-sector investment has fallen sharply from last year's gains, not only because of rising economic friction and uncertainty, says Barry Knap, managing partner at Ensead Macroeconomics.
Under the influence of policy uncertainty, business capital expenditure in the United States is expected to remain in a downward trend next year, Knap said.
While consumer growth provided a strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, analysts say there is growing evidence that economic and trade frictions and uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the U.S. consumer outlook.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers voluntarily mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a record for a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan.
Analysts generally believe that the U. S. economy will continue to slow.
But experts also say U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if trade and economic frictions are eased.
Kathleen Burch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the U.S. economy to continue its downward trend this year and grow at a slower pace than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy, predicts U.S. growth of 2.3 per cent this year and a further 1.6 per cent next year, assuming trade frictions do not escalate.
Alan Harzen, investment manager at Partner Investments, points out that the biggest concern for companies today is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they create. If economic and trade disputes are resolved, that uncertainty will diminish dramatically and the industrial sector will perform much better.
'Trade and economic frictions remain the 'top issue,' said Matt Melly, equity strategist at Miller-Tabac Asset Management Co. 'They're the main cause of the volatility in the U.S. capital markets this year and a proper resolution of those frictions will be the key to the direction of the markets for the rest of the year.
Parents can take 10 days off a year for children between 0 and 3 years of age
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is an embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth NPC Standing Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the "Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region" was adopted by a high vote.
This is Ningxia's first provincial-level enactment and promulgation of a comprehensive system to safeguard women's legitimate rights and interests of the local regulations, will be officially implemented on November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007.The Regulations are divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and supplementary rules.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave, which is the first in the country.
In April this year, the State Council's General Office issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children Under 3 Years of Age.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has put forward an innovative proposal, "Encouraging employing units to grant husband and wife who have children in accordance with laws and regulations to each of them ten days of joint child-rearing leave per year between the ages of zero and three".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the compilation of the personality rights of China's current Civil Code, and provides detailed provisions on the constitutional requirements of sexual harassment and the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment.
Section 44 of the Ordinance, which specifically prohibits frequent sexual assaults on girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, has become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Aiming at women's right to know and handle the common property of marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know and the duties of property registration agencies and related subjects, thus providing solid institutional support for women to protect their rights.
In addition, in response to the hot issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations prohibits not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination.
In recent years, the Joint Public Inspection Division of the Ningxia Women's Federation, civil affairs departments and other departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing social professionals to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and the fight against domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.A number of laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at and above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.

The on-site yield measurement of salt-tolerant rice not only injected hope for the upgrading of the middle-low-yield and high-yield rice fields in Xing'an League, but also provided scientific basis for the cultivation of salt-alkali rice in the same condition in China.
Australia's new state passed the legalization of abortion on September 26, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, AP reported.
The bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks and there have been serious disagreements within the Liberal Party since independent MP Kenny Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian Senate passed the legalization of abortion by 26 votes to 14 on Sunday, making it the third-longest-running bill in the Senate, the report said.
Abortion was legalized in the New State on Monday morning after a final vote in the House of Representatives.
The bill allows women to terminate pregnancy at 22 weeks and, if two doctors agree, to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment Tuesday night that allows doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of hospital advisors before performing an abortion for women 22 weeks after conception.
In addition, the Senate passed amendments that require doctors to provide adequate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, the governor had faced open criticism from conservatives over the bill, which she stepped in on several occasions to gain more time for debate, but did not attend the final vote.
"I need to spend time running the entire new state, " she said in defence of her absence.
Liberal MP John Davis, who was one of the strongest opponents of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government after calling it a "government crisis".
But then Davis gave in.
"The amendments to the abortion legalization bill that were tabled in the House of Representatives on the morning of 26th actually provide more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, New Australia National Party leader Barry Laroe says he is proud to be a member of the government that legalizes abortion.
"What we achieved last night was historic for the new state, making abortion legal, making abortion no longer a crime and treating abortion women as criminals," he said.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred state capital of 860.1 billion yuan to strengthen social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to strengthen social security funds, with a total transfer of about 860.1 billion yuan, Ministry of Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Tuesday.
Liu Kun made the remarks at a joint meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Administration of Finance on the same day on the tasks and deployment of the National Social Security Fund to replenish some state-owned capital.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, to share the development achievements of state-owned enterprises among the whole people and to fully reflect the equity of the basic old-age insurance system across generations, and is a policy measure that is based on the present and takes into account the long-term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for the Transfer of Some State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund," which requires some central enterprises and some provinces to be selected for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun introduction, transfer early stage work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been transferred in three batches, with a total transfer capital of about $860.1 billion.
Among them, the transfer of the central financial institutions that the Ministry of Finance performs the role of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with state-owned capital transferring to 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying a foundation for the next implementation of the transfer.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the central and local transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds will be fully launched in 2019.
The meeting held on that day made specific arrangements for the overall deferral.
The meeting stressed that the transfer should be carried out pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Time is tight and tasks heavy.
All regions and departments should carefully organize and arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed in accordance with the requirements, push forward the work in a solid manner, accurately grasp the contents of the transfer policy, strengthen communication and coordination, and promptly resolve difficult and doubtful issues, Liu said.
Transferring State Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund Starting from the point of enriching the sack of social security funds, the aim is to provide strong support for old-age protection.
However, this is not a simple equity " physical displacement ", but the opening of " mathematical addition. "
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly promulgated the Notice Concerning the Full Expansion of the Work of the Social Security Fund by Transferring Part of State Capital, specifying the timetable for the transfer of state capital to the social security fund.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, with the total transfer value exceeding 115 billion yuan.
According to regulations, social security foundations and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the rights of income, disposal and knowledge of state-owned shares.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that the changes in equity will not lead to changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In view of this, the author thinks that the similar state-owned enterprises equity transfer is not a simple change of ownership, but can inspire a series of effects of the addition operation.
The first step of transferring part of state capital to social security is to add results, which can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people and the sharing of development achievements by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, with strong overall profitability and relative stability.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously realizing to do better to become stronger.
On July 10, the State Council's executive meeting decided that the work of transferring some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds should be carried out in an all-round way this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, to push ahead the work of transferring part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in an all-round way, so as to fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and share the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises with the whole people.
The second step of transfer is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure. Most of the state funds transferred are capable of sustained profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide a source of fresh water for them.
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of basic old-age insurance paid and deposited by enterprises could be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of rotation, the addition result, is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
This transfer and undertake the main way to obtain income is " dividend-based, as a supplementary operation. "
As the financial investors of state-owned capital, the social security fund is really focused on earning equity dividends.
However, social security funds, as value investors in capital markets, have strong capability of capital operation.
As for listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, promote the management level of enterprises, and have a positive and positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, social security funds as the investment wind vane, the increase of heavy stakes in the market is conducive to further strengthen its influence in the market, and play a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guide investors to invest rationally and in value.

Iran Confirms Developing Advanced Centrifuge Further Suspension of Iran's Nuclear Accord
Iran has again violated its nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Monday.
Iran is reportedly steadily violating restrictions on its nuclear deal in response to President Trump's withdrawal in May 2018 and the resumption and tightening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran, which suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and its enriched uranium at a purity of 3.67 per cent, has moved further.
Under the agreement, Iran can only build up enriched uranium at Natanz with about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges and is allowed to use only a small number of more advanced models for research but not to produce enriched uranium.
Iran's success in developing more advanced centrifuges would allow it to produce uranium enrichment several times faster, possibly for use in bombs.
According to the report, the IAEA report states: "On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges developed for aircraft Nos. 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium enrichment".
"They are busy at the [Natanz enrichment] facility," a diplomat said in response to the IAEA's 26th report to Member States.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
'China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge,' the white paper said.
As China's overall strength and influence increases rapidly, there are fears that the country will follow a path of "strength without weakness" and so-called "China-threat doctrine," the white paper said.
There are cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, psychological imbalances brought about by the decline of power, and deliberate distortion in order to safeguard their vested interests.
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of all peoples to achieve national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.
China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth and the largest contributor to world economic growth, the white paper said.China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, making China's role as a stabilizer and engine of world economic growth even more prominent in the future.
At present, the world's economic growth is under-motivated, and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to improved economic development.New forms of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization have been accelerated, the economic structure has been deeply adjusted, industrial optimization has been continuously upgraded, and new economic growth spots have constantly emerged.
The McKinsey Global Research Institute's report says that by 2040, China's integration with the rest of the world economy is expected to generate $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15 to 26 per cent of the global economy.
The white paper stresses that China's economy and the world's have undergone structural changes that are deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term good for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to view China's economic development as a threat or a challenge and to try to push China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain and decouple it from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-directional opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend" .
China will unswervingly pursue a win-win strategy of opening up and achieve greater intensity and high-level opening-up.China has the most potential consumer market in the world, and China is the most attractive investment destination.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and for the benefit of one party.
Mutual benefit can be long-lasting.
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection.Other countries should also open wider and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment,' the white paper said.
Only when all sides are on the same footing can we create an environment of development that is open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger so as to form a mutually beneficial and win-win interest community.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods for the international community.
This will include promoting high-quality co-operation in building <unk>淪hanghai-Pacific Economic Cooperation<unk>?establishing a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
China's development benefits from the international community, and it never forgets to give back to the family of nations and provide more and better public goods to the international community.

Egyptian Authority Shows Forced Repression
Twitter themes and social media are vigorously urging Egyptians to take to the streets today to peacefully appeal to President Museveni to step down.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Disapproval has virtually disappeared in Egypt since the then military chief seized power in a 2013 coup, and any kind of protest would be in extreme danger.
The Guardian reports that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo NGO, says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests demanding Mr. Sessi's ouster.
Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday to protest corruption allegations that Mr. Sai and his family have spent public money in vain.
Egypt's Interior Ministry was adamant yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with decisiveness and no softness.
The streets around Tahrir Square, the site of the 2011 revolution, are littered with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police.
On the 25th, security forces detained a number of important scholars and social sages, including Cairo University political science professor, well-known columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that the continuation of absolute rule by Cecil will lead to disaster," he said in a postscript on the 24th.
His immediate departure is in Egypt's interest.
Mr Hosni, a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, was detained before Mr Nafa's arrest.
Mr. Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Mr. Sessi for the presidency.
Constitutional Party Chairman Saddam Hussein has also been detained.
Analysts and politicians say sweeping away dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of government at a time of increasing economic hardship for the poor and middle classes.
"The capture underscores the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and its own fears," said opposition leader Ayman Nour, who had once fought for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political repression, Mr. Sessi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may be his replacement."
Mr. Knoll notes that, given the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, government pressure will only increase people's anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a former Egyptian military construction contractor and now a merchant and actor in exile in Spain, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month claiming to have benefited from government corruption that sparked small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Mr. Ali says his firm, Amrak General Contractor, gets lucrative contracts without going through a legal tender process, stressing the corruption rife in the military and in his relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply saddened by his involvement.
Ali claimed he helped set Seychelles's magnificent palaces and luxury hotels in sharp contrast to Egypt's abject poverty and had not been paid for.
Twitter has attracted tens of thousands of tweets and replies calling for peaceful steps to be taken to the streets to demand Mr. Sessi's departure, with themes such as "You're not alone," "Sassi you're done," "Sassi get out of here," and "Next Friday.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarak has nearly seven million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday, he tweeted in Arabic: "Sassi is doomed. . . he is doomed, and his supporters are making a big mistake. "

42 countries and regions, such as Thailand and Egypt, unilaterally grant landing visas to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions, such as Indonesia, unilaterally allow Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to enter the country without a visa.
Besides visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, visa applications by Chinese citizens are becoming easier and easier.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa requirements.
These include agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina to issue multiple visas for travellers and businessmen of 10 years' validity, and with the United Kingdom to issue two-year multiple visas for travellers, businessmen and family members of the two countries.
The UK and Belgium jointly launched a one-stop visa service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.

"One turn, all the way" Transportation of Two Large-scale Special High Pressure Projects
±1100 kV DC Transmission Project and Sutong 1000 kV AC High Voltage GIL Comprehensive Pipe Corridor Project were put into operation.
These two projects occupy the vantage point of each field of transmission technology in the world at present. The large-scale optimization of energy allocation in China will be greatly enhanced after they are put into operation.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the State Energy Administration, said the project, from Jiangdong to South Anhui, is the world's largest power transmission capacity, the longest transmission distance of the project.
Its transportation is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensure the power supply in eastern China.
GIL, gaseous insulated metal enclosed transmission lines.
Sutong pipeline corridor project, has created the GIL project the world's highest voltage level, the transmission capacity of the strongest record, the realization of the East China backbone of the highest voltage level of the AC double-loop network's joint-loop operation.
According to the State Grid Company, the project from the southern Anhui province to the quasi-east transmission distance of 3324 kilometers.
With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost in the process, and the project has been developed to greatly increase the economical distance to over 3,000 km.
The project will deliver 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, thus helping to solve Xinjiang's problem of absorbing new energy.
At full capacity, the line alone could deliver between 600 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, meeting more than half the city's annual electricity consumption.
Sutong GIL Comprehensive Pipeline Corridor Project is a control project of superhigh voltage AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
A conventional overhead route across the Yangtze River would require two 450-metre towers on the river and an artificial island the size of four football fields for each.
To this end, the State Grid bold innovation, developed a compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology, through tunnels from the underwater river, to avoid the impact of the gold channel.
The two projects have promoted China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity to achieve a new leap.
At present, the national power grid has accumulated "10 to 11 straight" superhigh voltage project, and "4 to 3 straight" in construction.

White Paper: China Takes a Road of Development Consistent with National Conditions
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council Information Office issued a white paper on "China and the World in a New Era.
The white paper noted that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have successfully pioneered the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved development achievements that attract worldwide attention.
'China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work, ' the white paper said.
China's development relies on the "800 million pieces of shirt for a Boeing" driven spirit, on generations of continuous struggle and hard work that no one else can imagine; on the "carry one's own burden and bear one's own burden" spirit, whether in prosperity or adversity, not to export problems, not to pass on contradictions, not to buy, sell or pillage other countries; and on the "stone by stone" spirit of exploration, not to follow the old road of imperialism and colonialism, not to copy the development model of Western countries, but to combine China's reality, learn from its experiences and lessons, learn from human civilization, and make a daring endeavor to find its own way.
China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development through its interaction with the rest of the world, and its road is in line with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, the white paper said.
China has taken practical actions to safeguard world peace.
In the past 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict on its own initiative, nor has it invaded an inch of the land of any other country.
The White Paper points out that the fundamental reason why China has achieved great success in its development over the past 70 years is that it has found the right path to socialism with Chinese characteristics and has steadfastly followed it.
This is a road that has been established in the light of China's national conditions, puts the interests of the people first, reforms and innovations, seeks common development in openness and governs the country in an all-round way according to law.
Without centralized, unified and strong leadership, China will move towards fragmentation and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.

Chen Mingzhang, dean of the Taipei Graduate School of Business, said trade frictions between China and the US continued and Taiwanese businessmen faced an “uncertain era”.
He said Taiwanese businessmen need to keep abreast of the latest developments in mainstream industries on the mainland, especially innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
In the past, Taiwanese traders valued quality, effectiveness and delivery.
Chen Mingzhang believes that Taiwanese merchants only the above-mentioned conditions are not enough at the moment.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up supply chain speed, focus on extended services and life product services.
In addition, "service value-added" is a new area that Taiwanese businessmen can develop vigorously.
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the event, Mr Hui Wentang, Chairman of AGI Electronics Co. Ltd., a Taiwanese merchant from Guangdong, said that AGI Electronics had been experiencing operational difficulties due to the sudden drop in orders.

Customer replacement of suppliers depends on the following six factors: poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, a small variety of products, integrity problems. To solve these six factors, together with the timely transformation of production lines and expansion of product categories, enterprises will become irreplaceable suppliers to customers.

Recruiting Opinions from New Regulations: Social Capital Needs Qualifications to Acquire Rural Land Management Rights
Acquisition of Rural Land Management Right by Social Capital Needs Qualifications
Public Consultation on Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management right
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right (Amendment Draft to solicit comments) (hereinafter referred to as the draft comments) to solicit public views, adding regulation and risk prevention for the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management right.
The draft comments are now open for public comment.
In order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the rural basic management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the three-power division system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights and formed the "Draft Opinions".
Beijing Youth Daily reporters learned that the first publication of the draft "Opinion" several important revisions.
The newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law clarifies the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of separation of the three powers.It sets up separate sections of "Land Contracting and Management Rights" and "Land Management Rights", and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, interchange and transfer of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, stock ownership or other ways).
In this Opinion Draft, in order to implement the concept of "three powers divided" and effectively respond to the gist of the amendment of the Rural Land Contract Law, and taking into account the great differences in parties, procedures and supervision between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land management rights, the scope of circulation is defined in this Amendment Draft, which focuses on the circulation of land management rights.
For the transfer and exchange of land contract management rights, administrative measures will be promulgated separately.
Under the "three powers divided" background, farmers only have the right to operate the land for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers only have the risk of losing their right to operate for a certain period of time.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing their land, priority shares, leasing shares first, buying back shares and so on have come into being in practice.
Considering that the preferred stock has already been discussed in the company law, it is suggested to take it as an advocacy provision to guard against the risk of losing ownership.
