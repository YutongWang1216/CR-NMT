Women's volleyball team is expected to defend the title of World Cup ahead of time!
In the match against the Dutch women's volleyball team on the 27th, China's two consecutive wins in the opponents were pulled back to a city, the final 3 - 1 Lique Holland, ushered in nine consecutive wins.
China's women's volleyball team should not be taken lightly in the face of Serbia, although the World Cup is drawing to a close.
In the first two sets of the match against Holland, the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever, beating 25:19,25:16 to the next two cities until the third.
Dutch women's volleyball team in the backward situation to strengthen the offensive service, the Chinese team hit a pass, coupled with the girls aggressive, errors began to increase, the opponents were finally 21:25 back to a city.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the match: "The third inning, because the mistake we sent about 8 points. "
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball team also prepared for difficulties before the game, although the loss of one inning, but everything is still in Lang Ping's hands. "It is normal to play against a strong team win or lose, playing five innings is normal, so we said to the players to focus," Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive firepower, a single game to get 8 points, for the team to win a great success.
China's women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but the match against the Netherlands is a real wake-up call for the Chinese women's volleyball team: the more critical the moment, the harder it has to go.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball team finished five games, the United States did not take all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team only three points against Serbia to achieve an early round of defending the title.
All sorts of situations are developing in favour of Chinese women's volleyball.
However, despite Serbia's absence of all six major players, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to China.
In the current table form, Serbia has largely lost a medal, which means they can "lighten up" against the Chinese women's volleyball team, relinquish the baggage to hit their opponents, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the title, the situation may fluctuate.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not the lamb, the previous battle with the Netherlands, the two sides in five games, Serbian 2 team finally 3-2 reversed the Dutch main line-up, this shows the depth of the line-up.
Before the start of the third stage, Lang Ping also said the Dutch and Serbian teams were unable to cope: "Osaka will be a very difficult game, we will continue to prepare carefully.
Now the trumpet of defending the crown has been sounded, and the game has really entered the "white-hot stage".
In terms of strength, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above their opponents, only at the last critical juncture, depending on whether the women's volleyball team can play their normal level, in the field to release themselves.

... span class='class1'>The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary with a flood of media spotlights flashing with images we don't normally remember - it's they who bring heat and light to our shiny days.
However, if a hero walks beside him, he seems to be as ordinary as you and me.
... span class='class1'>Yuan Longping devoted himself to rice research and cultivated good seeds all over the world so that billions of Chinese people would not be discouraged by hunger.
They, seeking benevolence, live a simple, simple and persistent life, so long as they immerse themselves in the cause of foreigners and their broomstick self-precious, it is easy to be happy, regardless of the bridle of fame, wealth and glory.
As in Jin Yong's novels, the sweeping monk at the Shaolin Temple's Tibetan scripture pavilion, though awe-inspiring martial arts scholarship, does not show off his reserve, does not have joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeper monk" , every pair of naked-hearted sons, has a homeland to bear.
Countries bear the burden, not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also on the palms of millions of people.
Once upon a time, the words of a high school girl were turned crazy by the netizens. "When a hero passes by, someone sits by the side of the road and applauds ... I don't want to be a hero.
Actually, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
He who applauds by the side of the road is passing heat and light, and he himself is a luminous body.
Ordinary as you are like me, there are always some opportunities in life, some moments, there is a cumulative accumulation of years, is also shaping the appearance of heroes.
Zhou Bihua, an outstanding judge in Shanghai, took on the task of reforming the judicial system, but at the annual meeting he asked the old master of the communications room to come on stage and tell his story.

For example, "China Eye" now seems like a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Tzu-shing had not yet started to write "Three Bodies".
The cattle's eyes were then Arecibo, a one-sided radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico in the United States, 350 metres in diameter, considered the world's most insurmountable.
At that time, Chinese radio telescopes were less than one tenth the diameter of others.
But Nanrendong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home with the near-crazy idea of building a new generation of radio telescopes in China to receive more information from outer space.
China awaits rejuvenation by investing huge sums of money to play with stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, and the "Tianye" project kicks off.
It took 12 years to select the site and 9 years to complete the project.
With the opening of the 500 - meter - caliber Skyeye, China has accomplished a " world - wide and unique scientific project " without precedent.
Therefore, the "sky eye" is remarkable, the southeast benevolence people are remarkable, has the tolerance is big, stands the distant republic is remarkable.
With the trust of the state, the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have the opportunity to become the souls of the people.
Young talents, gray-haired heroes, there are people in the roadside gently applause, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.

Chirac's death The political legacy remains
Former French President Jacques Chirac passed away on Tuesday at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing an unprecedented upheaval in a century, many of the political legacies of the French politician's reign are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served as France's president for 12 years in a charismatic manner.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Charles de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration, is chasing the "European Dream" representative.
At the same time, he also strongly advocated the world multipolarization and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of politicians.
That is why the French media have described him as "the distinguished representative of France on the world stage".
One of Mr Chirac's favourite political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany in the forefront of the anti-war defiance of American pressure.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would intensify terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
It turned out that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is at a loss and American unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the "Golden Decade" in China-France relations.Since he was first elected president of France in 1995, China-France relations have been developing rapidly from a statesman's strategic point of view.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a completely new stage.
During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in various fields, such as aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation, made breakthroughs.
The Sino-French Cultural Year initiated by Chirac has created a new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong devotion to Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can recite some of Li Bai, Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the history of Chinese bronze ware.
"No pyramids, no real visits to Egypt, no terra-cotta figures, no real visits to China" The phrase comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "Western countries have concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and its political status in the world.
But I have confidence in China myself.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization and its experience is enough to help it build ideas and values for achieving harmonious development and take on its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The scribes have gone, but the political heritage and revelations that Chirac left to the world will endure.

HKSAR Legislative Council Established Members Joint Office Against U.S.-related Bills
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a joint statement on the 27th, the U.S. Senate and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee passed the "Hong Kong Bill of Human Rights and Democracy" expressed strong opposition.
Hong Kong enjoys rights conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, including economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, in the name of Hong Kong, China.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in a wide range of co-operation in related fields.
The statement said it was unnecessary for the U.S. Senate and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees to pass the bill in response to calls from their Hong Kong-related agents as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong.
Constitutional lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus, the statement said.
Hong Kong's good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
The passage of the U.S. bill would not only hurt Hong Kong and the U.S. itself, but would also further aggravate China-U.S. relations at the expense of others.
The statement said Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy the rights conferred upon it by the Basic Law, effectively fulfilling its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade in the past, present and future.
France's parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported.
In response, French President Jacques Maclone recently declared that his country could not "tolerate all", but was also trying to "well accommodate".
Reported that Mr. Maclone is trying to find a compromise on immigration, to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In an interview during the general debate at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Mr. Maclone said he hoped there would be a 'double-edged' approach to immigration that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"France cannot accept all [immigrants] if it wishes to do so properly," he said.
Mr. Maclone outlined four main points of immigration policy: the expeditious granting of asylum status to refugees in need of protection; more efficient integration of migrants; the reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and the more efficient resettlement of persons who entered France illegally and were not suitable for stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "State Medical Assistance" (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion before.
Mr Maclone said he would like to be able to “evaluate” the system, but would not abolish it, but would impose restrictions.
Following his remarks, Le Penny Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Union, called his statement "empty talk".
The right-wing Republican, Senate Speaker Mitch Rushmore, also said immigration policies should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Mr. Maclone.
Mr Varo, a member of the left-wing Socialist Party, argued that France should "better and more receptive" to immigration and criticised Mr. Maclone for "manipulating" the issue.
The new Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been enacted for a year, has led to divisions of opinion within the ruling party but has failed to placate the right-wing opposition.
In the next election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of attack on the far right, and Mr. Maclone needs to do something about it, but risks infuriating left-wing members within the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly is reported to be debating immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are on the threshold of a "repurchase wave", with many listed companies offering "real gold and silver" to repurchase their shares.
As of 27th, the total amount of repurchase funds implemented for listed A-share companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding previous figures for the same period, according to financial data service provider Orient Wealth.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Rong Information Consulting Co., said the low overall valuation of the A-share market this year and the relatively low price of share buy-backs would help listed companies improve the efficiency of their use of capital, reflect the willingness of listed companies to take the initiative to manage their market value and the abundant cash flow, and help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for the implementation of share repurchase by listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for share repurchase by listed companies.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan this year are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing industries.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
At the top of the list were Yili's shares, which were repurchased for more than $5 billion.
What effect will the repurchase shares of listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, told China News Agency that on the one hand, the repurchase shows that listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial position, are capable of maintaining price stability and giving investors confidence. On the other hand, the repurchase also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are accountable to the company, market and investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the core of the basic elements.
Repurchase of shares of listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the price of shares of listed companies.
According to the China Eastern Securities Research Report, the total number of share buy-backs set by listed A-share companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average transaction price of repurchase shares, is expected to bring incremental funds for the A-share market to surpass 150 billion yuan this year.

The launching ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport was held on September 25.
Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal Building is known as the first of the Seven Wonders of the New World.
Beijing Capital International Airport is now overloaded, carrying 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta.
By 2022, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers and 20 percent of international flights; by 2025, 72 million passengers and 30 percent of international flights.
As a new gateway, how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City of Hebei Province.
Its terminal has a steel roof frame with a projected area of 180,000 square metres and 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two levels of arrival and departure - F1 - F4 is international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, international departure.
The two-storey bridge connecting the highway outside the terminal building with the airport corresponds to the F3 and F4-international departure levels respectively. Both domestic departures are acceptable.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport began the era of "double airport" in Beijing.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new power source for national development and an integrated Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regional transport hub supporting the construction of the Xiong'an New Area.So far, 66 airlines have been interested in entering Beijing Daxing International Airport, 20 of them domestic, 46 from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and foreign airlines.
During the winter and spring season, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international routes.
This forms a "double hub" airport pattern with coordinated development, moderate competition and first-class international competitiveness with Beijing Capital International Airport, which not only relieves the pressure on the capacity saturation of the capital airport, but also better meets the urgent needs of the rapid growth of air transport in and around Beijing and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport has taken full account of its geographical location, the relationship between the airport and its surrounding airspace and operating environment.For the first time in China, the airport runway has adopted a "all-directional" layout, adopted the world's largest air traffic control automation system, and established China's largest terminal control area, thus maximizing the efficiency of aviation operation.
Domestic airports of this scale use the localized baggage automatic processing and information management system for the first time, and adopt innovative baggage transfer mode to improve the efficiency of baggage handling system.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, the first flight, a harbinger of the Phoenix flaunting cool takeoff.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic airports with a localization rate of 98 percent or more, will surely have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.

Shandong Shouguang County Committee secretary Wang Boxiang - Qiangxian Fumin Chizixin - Xinhua
Born in February 1943, Wang Boxiang took part in the work in 1967 and served successively as party secretary, secretary of county committee and mayor of townships and towns.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang appointed the secretary of Shandong Shouguang County Committee, then Shouguang is Weifang's poor county.
During Shouguang's five years in office, Wang concentrated his efforts on three things: first, to promote the industrialization of vegetables; secondly, to develop the salt-alkali beaches in Shouguang; and thirdly, to lay the foundation for the industry to turn over, so that Shouguang people from the pockets, upright waist.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but also the lessons of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a bumper harvest of vegetables but could not sell them.
Wang Boxiang investigation found that the key to grasping vegetables is to do a good job of circulation.
Shouguang first set up a wholesale vegetable market, opened the prelude to the development of the market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead, screw up, and all losses should be borne in the county.
In 1989, with Wang's support, 17 party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, set up 17 winter-warming vegetable shelters, when 17 "double-thousand-yuan households" appeared in the village.
Afterwards the county set up the promotion team, under Wang Boxiang's mobilization, Wang Leyi toured the towns and villages to guide; in the first year promoted more than 5000 vegetable canopy, then the vegetable canopy such as a prairie fire to the county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million mu of land in Shoubei except for the salt-alkali beaches, is shallow beaches.
The local people live a hard life.
Shou Nan has a vegetable canopy, Shoubei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized 100,000 people to engage in a general assembly war, camped on the waste alkaline beach, forty or fifty days at a time.
At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and developed "pots of treasure" on the salt-alkali beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county committee.
During the meeting, a "Comparison Table of Industrial Economic Figures for Urban Areas in Twelve Countys of Weifang City" was issued.
But if the raw salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output is worth only 119 million yuan, ranking third to last.
Wang Boxiang took a group of more than 70 people to a foreign country to "change his mind" .
Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, we have organized "Learn Scriptures" tours to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai every year.
Shouguang lack of enterprises, but also lack of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the holding of a special conference film board: in the county public selection of factory managers, 40 "professional talents" stand out, was pushed to the industrial front line.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang deputy mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 vegetable shelters, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4.54 enterprises, more than 100,000 households, and a rank of officials recognized by the people.
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of China and African Security Council Member States at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Foreign Ministers of Ce d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ojono, Pandol, South Africa and Niger, as well as Tunisian Foreign Minister Jainawi, attended the meeting.
Wang Yi put forward four proposals on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, it depends on unity and strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms governing international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is undermined and the interests of developing countries, including African countries, as well as small and medium-sized countries, are compromised.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to join hands and shoulder to shoulder so that unity can be strengthened.
In the Security Council, three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just with four votes, but with other countries following suit, influencing and shaping the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2001, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which should be fully utilized.
Second, settle disputes by negotiation.
China has always advocated a political settlement of hot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has also experienced successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly the hot spots in Africa, are largely the scourges of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We should make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and give full play to the role of the UN in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, self-improvement through self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve them well.
In addressing hot issues in Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capacity-building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, relying on development to govern the fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are both developing countries.We must give top priority to economic and social development and support each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to work closely with the African Union Agenda 2063, the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
We should work together to increase UN investment in Africa's development.
The outbreak of the Ebola outbreak in Congo has re-emerged, and China has given and will continue to give its full support, providing human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate its actions with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations and WHO to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo.

Wuhan to Promote Intellectualized Transformation of Industrial Enterprises Up to 20 Million Dollars Subsidy
Reporter 27 from the Wuhan Municipal Government Press Office held a series of "Li Zan New China Xiying Military Games" city press conferences learned that this year, the city has speeded up industrial intellectualization transformation, and implemented a maximum of 20 million yuan transformation subsidy measures.
So far, more than 800 large-scale industrial enterprises have been collected intelligent transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Economic and Information Technology Bureau, said that from this year onwards, Wuhan has launched an action plan for the intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises to provide free consultation and diagnostic services to industrial enterprises above the scale of demand, and to propose solutions to promote the new round of technological transformation of high-level enterprises in an all-round way.
According to the plan, Wuhan openly selects a batch of specialized diagnostic service institutions each year to conduct a survey of the intellectualized transformation needs of all industrial enterprises above the scale of the city through the opening of columns, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door reporting.
So far, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have been collected on the intellectualized transformation needs of information, accounting for more than one-third of the city's industrial enterprises.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter enterprises in batches to carry out "one-on-one" on-the-spot evaluation and program demonstration.
At present, the city is organizing 373 intellectualized transformation projects, with a total investment of 29.76 billion yuan.Hongxin Communications China's first 5G intellectualized production line, Motorola's leading national intellectualized mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, Aerospace Science and Technology's first mass-satellite production line, Huisheng biological world's leading new veterinary drug intelligent production line, and Europe's leading intelligent home Internet of Things intelligent production line have started construction.

Among them, those who carry out intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises shall be invested according to their actual conditions; those who invest in equipment and hardware, and those who invest in R&D and soft investment shall be granted 8%, with a transition subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
Meanwhile, financial institutions such as the Joint Exchange Bank and the Wuhan Branch of Zhejiang Commercial Co., Ltd. are actively engaged in providing personalized financial services for the intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises, thus greatly easing the pressure on enterprise financing.
Trudo's collapse, can he be re-elected successfully
This time Trudo stumbled out of the "big hole" at his heels. It was Trudo himself who dug it up little by little.
Recently, Canadian media revealed a series of incumbent Prime Minister Trudo, in which he disguised himself as a black image.
It was seen as a clear act of racial discrimination that caused uproar in Canada.
Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public after the incident.
However, Canadians don't buy much.
Trudo lifted a stone and threw it at his own feet.
Since the rise of the anti-black-faced movement in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have, as political commentators and others have pointed out, loudly accused the opposition or dissidents within their own party of "great loss" in this regard and have repeatedly threatened "whoever makes this mistake deserves immediate dismissal".
To put it simply, this time Trudo stumbled out of the "big hole" at his heels, which Trudo himself had dug up little by little.
The handsome young son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, Trudo had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first made his debut.
Formerly a "political vegetarian", he took over as head of the Federal Liberal Party (LDP) and fought an unexpectedly good battle in Canada's federal legislative elections in 2015 when the FNL won valuable separate cabinet seats in the lower house of the Federal Assembly.
At that time, Trudo put forward many dozen platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the eradication of corruption and "unhealthy practices".
However, during his five years in office, he has "gone high and gone low" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In the case of "ethnic and gender equality," let alone "black-faced," after he "flinched" over a range of aboriginal issues, prompting aboriginal groups and leaders to move their protest tents to the Capitol on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In the fight against corruption, Trudo was embroiled in the boiling "Lan Wan Ling" earlier this year.
It has been exposed to a major malpractice for personal gain by its home construction company, Lan Wanling, pressuring the departments and officials responsible for investigating and punishing the latter to "hold their hands high".
Moreover, Trudo became angry with the disclosure officer, Wang Zhoudi, who was the Canadian Attorney General when he was the first to disclose the case and handle it directly.
Although the case itself is doubtful, but its suspicion is difficult to wash away.
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudo's five-year rule was largely the result of his own "digging hole" and that the biggest "digging holes" were the "tiger-headed snake-tailed snake-tailed tiger-headed snake-tailed tiger-headed snake-tailed tiger-headed snake-tailed tiger-headed snake-tailed tiger-tailed tiger-tailed tiger-headed tiger-headed man.
Support for Trudo has slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent since 2015, while opposition has soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent, according to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reed poll.
Despite the equally poor performance of other opposition parties and their leaders, even a significant proportion of voters who are willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismissive of the prime minister, the ruling party's leader.
With the new Canadian federal legislative election due to begin on October 21, will Trudo be able to repeat the drama that won five years ago?
The answer may be just one word: difficult.
Whether from the enterprise competition level, the consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration level, all have far-reaching influence and positive significance.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened to traffic.
Xinjing News reporters from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission learned that the capital airport has been in a state of super-saturated operation, Daxing International Airport opened, will enhance the capability of the capital's aviation services.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international shipping aviation.
Daxing Airport, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more positive impact.
The capital airport had more than 100 million passenger trips in 2018, ranking first in the country.However, compared with the fast-growing business demand, there is still a significant shortfall in capacity, especially on international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of passengers at home and abroad, such as tourism and business trips, and meet the trend of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected cities, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of cargo and postal throughput in the future.
Therefore, the location of the two airports do not overlap, respectively for different groups of customers, there are sufficient market space.
From the point of view of economic accounts, Daxing International Airport's air traffic will obviously have a win-win effect, easing the tension in Beijing's air capacity, speeding up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake for the capital's dual-nuclear operation.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to concentrate on the capital airport in the future, but also to reduce a series of problems caused by the over-concentration of routes, such as the longer check-in time, the slower boarding speed of passengers, indirectly increasing the detention time of aircraft and passengers at the airport, aggravating the burden of airport operation, and actually improving the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media calculation of the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, such as the Beijing-Kaijing Expressway from the South Five Ring Road directly to Daxing Airport Expressway, if you drive in 50 minutes, you can get around 40 yuan for fuel and 15 yuan for high speed.
Overall, there are a variety of means of transportation available to the public to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing Airport is located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little far away from the Beijing area, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect. Besides the new airport line from Beijing District to Daxing Airport, there are many expressways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding area.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can travel to Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou via expressways such as Guangdong, Guangdong and Shenzhen, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an New Areas around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport for convenient and efficient air services.
This shows that Daxing International Airport has not only added a few runways and a few aircraft, but also has far-reaching influence and positive significance from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration.It not only concerns the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also provides diversified choices for the travel of the residents of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei shipping industry, promotes the further improvement of the service quality of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei shipping industry, and promotes the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the economic small accounts of individuals, but also account for the overall development of large accounts.

Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum held in Chengtianshun province
Earlier this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to grow, according to Nguyen Tak-kin, deputy director of the Congressional Economic Committee.
The forum focuses on economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of population planning and proposes measures for economic and social development by the end of population planning and 2020.
In the Forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on the economic development and the impact of some FTAs in population planning, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in population planning, outstanding issues in Vietnam's social and cultural planning, and forecasts and recommendations for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that global economic growth slowed in the first few months of 2008, with increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund has determined that despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, of which 70 per cent of the world's economies have stagnated, Vietnam's economy has achieved many encouraging results, with macroeconomic stability, effective control of inflation and an average 2.64 per cent increase in consumer price inflation in the first half of 2008, the lowest rate in nearly three years.
GDP growth of 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2007, although lower than 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, is still relatively high compared with the same period in 2011.
Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Centre for Economic and Social Forecasting, said that in the face of global economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy is showing a relatively high growth momentum in the coming year.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic situation will remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will promote trade development, further strengthen economic restructuring and improve the business environment, and Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend due to trade frictions.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring and early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, and seek opportunities to expand new export markets so as to facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, controlling inflation at a reasonable level will promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the past 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more to improving global economic governance and promoting common global development.
As the world's second-largest economy, China has contributed more than 30% to world economic growth, Liu said.In particular, China's 鈥淐hina Development Initiative鈥?has led to deepening cooperation between local provinces and municipalities and the provinces of Siem Reap and its territory.
He said that this year marks the 61st year since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, which enjoy brotherly friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries will be the driving force for local economic and social development.
The governor of Siem Reap Province, De Seha, highly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated Cambodia and China on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
He hoped that the two sides would continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual trust and benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
So far, Siamese Province has established friendly relations with China's 28 provinces and municipalities, large-scale cultural performance projects such as Angkor Smile and Angkor Dynasty have landed, Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, Siem Reap New International Airport Project, Siem Reap Provincial Government Officials' Special Training Course, Siem Reap Scholarship for Studying in China, Rural Volunteer Clinics, Reconstruction of Urban Roads and Reconstruction of Cataract Public Interest Project, etc.
State Secretary of the Cambodian Ministry of Defence Ken Mansong, Chairman of the Council of Siem Reap Province Weng Heng, Governors of the five provinces of the territory, members of the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian Council of China, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, Chinese-funded enterprises and foreign consulates in Siem Reap attended the reception.
China's 10 Years of Cloud Rise in Yunqi Town - Xinhua
If 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25-27 in Hangzhou held in the U.S. has been a full decade of the conference.
From the concept of “in the clouds” to the practice of “up in the clouds”, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that underpin China’s economic development, social management and public services over a decade.
At the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new "colleague" loaded with Aliyun's artificial intelligence has recently been placed next to quality inspectors.
It is 24 hours non-stop, recognition speed is more than twice as fast as manual, quality control accuracy at more than 95%.
The camera-based quality inspector, who has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, quickly converted infrared images into binary language and sorted defective batteries with the power of cloud computing, the company's director said.
The company is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing-assisted manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for the Implementation of Promoting Enterprises to the Cloud ( 2018-2020)" in 2018, which states that by 2020, the enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm to the cloud will be significantly enhanced, and the proportion and application depth of the cloud will be significantly enhanced.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has bridged and paved the way for a digital economy with key elements, says Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun.
Meanwhile, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has been expanding over the past decade.
The overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017, according to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year.
In addition to becoming the key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible clouds have also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi conference, the three-year appearance of the "urban brain" is still a cause for concern.
The city's brain has moved from a vehicle for transportation management to a hub for urban management, and cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world, Ali said.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city's brain, with its powerful computing power, enables new urban management services such as parking first and paying later, real-time perception of the number of visits, and travel route design.
In the area of government services, cloud computing facilitates both ends of the supply of government services by connecting "one cloud" with "one thing".
At present, Zhejiang has constructed the province's unified public data platform through government affairs.
By September 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, collecting and managing 3,066 categories of 19.80 billion data.
Zhejiang government departments have called and shared an average of 12 million data calls a month, and every time the data moves over the cloud, it may mean that the masses run less errands.
Carefully use plastic tea bags to make tea!
A bag of tea bags could release billions or even tens of billions of particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of micro-plastics, but so far there is no evidence that consumption of such particles poses a threat to humans, according to a new Canadian study.
Researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reportedly found that dipping a plastic tea bag into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nano-plastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
According to research released earlier in 2008, the average person eats at least 50,000 particles of plastic each year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, examined four different types of plastic commercial tea bags at Montero stores and coffee shops, opened them, washed them and dipped them in almost boiling water for five minutes before being analyzed using an electronic microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion particles of plastic "several stages higher than the plastic load of other foods previously".
Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some branded tea bags are no longer made of paper but are made of plastic, which the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, which researchers have defined to be between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size, largely caused by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found particles of plastic in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, the researchers first discovered particles of plastic in human excrement samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing particles of plastic, the Canadian team put water fleas in contaminated water and found that microplastics affect their behavior and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization, there is so far no evidence that consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how the plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
The researchers speculate that the bags release large amounts of plastic particles, possibly because they come into contact with boiling water and can break down or exude toxic substances even when they are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres says climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster will erode the fruits of a generation's development.
This is illustrated by the disasters in the hurricane-hit regions of Baghdad, Dominica and the Bahamas so far this year.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at altitudes of 5 metres or less.
Relocations can seriously affect their societies and lifestyles and even raise questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At Monday's climate action summit, small island nations are once again taking the world in the right direction as they work together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is building new injustices on old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States have contributed little to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are still caught up in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage their disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and move to renewable sources of energy; and urged international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly the heavily indebted middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the "wholesome" consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once a century may have occurred in many regions every year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without substantial investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere," Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples for the world to learn from."
He emphasized that small island developing States were special examples of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's financial system is well-liquid and economic growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the current fiscal year, driven by holiday consumer demand, Finance Minister Mittal Sitaraman said Thursday.
Mr. Sitaraman made the remarks after meetings with representatives of India's private banks, non-banking financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitaraman did not specify the point of the remarks.
Some Indian and overseas media have blamed liquidity constraints at non-bank financial institutions for the continuing slowdown in India's economy.
Citing the decline in auto sales as an example, Mr. Sitaraman denied that liquidity constraints were the main reason for the decline.
Citaraman points out that the decline in auto sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
Mr. Sitaraman expects India's economic growth, driven by holiday spending, to resume in the second half of the fiscal year.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and lasts until the end of the year.
Markets expect consumption to boost India's economic growth considerably.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice, strictly forbidding the province's primary and secondary schools during the National Day holiday in violation of remedial classes, and will organize personnel random inspection and secret visits.

The notice made it clear that the local administrative departments of education in primary and secondary schools will intensify the deduction of points in the current year's examination of education conducted by the county-level governments; teachers who participate in the illegal remedial work will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of teachers' ethics.
Supporting pig production and ensuring market supply
Sui Loyalty Requests Implementation of Measures from Six Aspects
The province's teleconference on promoting the supply of pigs in the market was held today to re-mobilize and re-deploy policies and measures adopted by the central government, provincial governments and provincial governments to support the supply of pigs in the market.
Sui Loyalty requirements, from six aspects to do a good job of pig production measures to implement.
Grasp "vegetable basket" the mayor responsible for the implementation of the system, this year the province's clear 45 million pigs out of the task has been decomposed into the city and state, into the responsibility system assessment.
We should do a good job in implementing various policies and measures and effectively solve the problem of "last kilometer" .
We should do a good job in the production and implementation of breeding sows, earnestly implement the subsidy policy for breeding sows, encourage breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of breeding pigs, and select in a planned way excellent sows from among commercial pig populations.
We should do a good job in attracting investment and take the well-known domestic large-scale aquaculture enterprises which have not yet entered our province as the top priority in attracting investment.
We should do a good job in implementing the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs, and promote the transformation from "pigs" to "meat" in an all-round way.
We must do a good job in implementing the modern epidemic prevention system.All localities should be equipped with quarantine personnel at the grass-roots level corresponding to the scale and tasks of breeding and establish the first line of defense against and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui Loyalty requests, fully guarantees the meat market supply, ensures that does not appear the large-scale shortage, the large-scale disconnection, guarantees the major holiday pork market supply is stable.
The conference also made arrangements for the prevention and control of swine fever in Africa, the ban on catching and catching in the important waters of the Yangtze River basin in our province, and the acquisition of rice in the middle and late stages of the province.

"Some construction sites are estimated to account for more than half of the over-age migrant workers.
Where can I find a young worker now?
There's no way to use so many'old people'on the construction site, either.
Recently, there are a lot of over-aged migrant workers (over retirement age) on the construction site, said Zou Kui, a long-term contractor in the construction industry.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities to carry out rain and sewage diversion projects, there are a lot of migrant workers in the campus, if you look carefully, you will find that there are many over-aged migrant workers.
Over-aged migrant workers go out to work not because they are "not idle", but because they are "not idle", because of the helplessness and hardship of having to do so - whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems or help their children, it is driving these supposedly "leisurely" elderly people to continue to work hard.
The "old-age dependency" of over-aged migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing for their children to study, helping them build houses and buy cars, helping them start a family, and raising their grandchildren from generation to generation, when these migrant workers have fulfilled their "life tasks", their moneybags have been emptied and even a lot of debts remain, and most of them lack the accumulation of wealth.
In order not to drag their children and to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing it until it is too late".
The reluctance of many new generations of migrant workers after '80' or '90' or even '00' to engage in secondary or low-end services under difficult conditions has created structural 'labour shortages' that offer opportunities for over-aged migrant workers.
Due to a lack of skills and a decline in physical functions and working capacity, many over-aged migrant workers are engaged in jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and low security.
The plight of the over-aged migrant workers behind "no leisure" cannot be ignored or ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid wages and wages, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income and improve the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers, apart from their self-saving, cannot be separated from the public sector's institutional protection and humane care.
Some scholars point out that the over-aged migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their old-age and medical problems, they have to support their families through other means.
Understanding the over-aged migrant workers "cannot idle" help us better understand the love and pain of over-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and finding ways to get them back to the countryside to truly achieve "old dependency" require a shared responsibility among the public sector, the market and society, as well as a concerted effort.
Mr. Chemetzov said Russia would not export such a system for the next five years because "it must first supply its own troops before export production takes place".
This practice is in full conformity with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence requirements before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grehov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Force, said work on the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antai" air defense Kancheen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that use the working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some sources, S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in close space.
Such weapons can also be integrated with other anti-aircraft systems into a unified network, particularly the S-400 system, which is important from a defence standpoint.
Sergei Chemetzov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
The modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic Anti-aircraft Regiment on New Territories Island has been completed, according to news from September 15.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defense ministry says this is entirely a process within the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace of the Arctic region has increased markedly," the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service said.
It is important that the military assess the success of the system in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
The officers and soldiers of the anti-aircraft regiment trained for the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, there is still a part of it.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying air targets, whether they are targets flying at high altitudes or "fish leaking out of nets" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Golden Diamond-Antai Air Defense Co., is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometers per second within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the Arctic to ensure the safety of airspace over the northern sea routes.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the Arctic air defence system.
Russia's defense ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Thor" forces in the future will be expanded to a complete brigade-level system.
Together with the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on New Territories and the Koala Peninsula, as well as the "Pantsir-SA" short-range systems deployed in the Arctic, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons strongly defend Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will find it difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their wares, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian store operator, many Russian companies specialize in selling Russian goods in China.
Russian products have online stores on China's biggest trading platforms, such as Small, Jingdong JD, 1688, Purindu assiduous, ShouQ, and Wechat, and have their own online platforms, Spin assiduous.com and Russian merchandise retail chain stores.
Russia Export Center and Russian products will jointly develop store marketing strategies and participate in standards, and screen virtual shelf products enterprises.
The store plans to open before the end of this year and shelves the products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the data from the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits to the platform of Chinese electricity suppliers reached 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and have exceeded $1 billion by 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the framework of the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
The new store will display merchandise from businesses with sales of at least 500 million roubles, according to Alexa Kozyffnikov.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher, and 500 million roubles in sales are not enough.
As we all know, Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green products.
'The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying, ' Mr. Kournikov said.
"Our goal is to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years, " he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian enterprises in the Far East products.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the basic teaching and research department of trade policy at Russia's Plekhanov Economic University, said: "This is a political project representing the image of both sides because the Russian export centre is a state-owned rather than a private institution."
"I don't see a lot of very competitive Russian goods on the market. "
He said the project is unlikely to be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 Russian companies have posted product information on the largest international wholesale online platform, Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China as well as other countries, Russian news agency said during the Eastern Economic Forum.
There is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also serve as the organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the center for commercial project events, signing of agreements, presentations and meetings with representatives of Chinese enterprises.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: "In addition to the agricultural stands, we are bound to hold business meetings, that is, to arrange direct linkages between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts aimed at supporting enterprises and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them. "
There will also be a Masters' class, a culinary contest and a Russian food fair for famous Russian chefs under the "Shanghai Station to Explore Russian Food".
Police awaited a full report and instructions from the Attorney General's Office to take the next steps after the Moham Adi coroner's office ruled on Friday that the cause of death was unintentional.
According to the coroner's ruling, police will await further instructions from the Attorney General's Office, the National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau said in a statement Friday.
In his statement, he stressed that the police never ceased to investigate the death of Mohamwe, and the investigation is still under way.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noah Occupancy said police would wait for a full report on the verdict before taking action.
He responded to a question Friday morning after attending a ceremony at the state police headquarters for the transfer of powers to the deputy chief constable.

When will the next bus come?
"Internet + Smart Station" lets you know.
Nanjing will have 54 electronic bus screens lit when the country's first Internet+smart stations are officially launched in Nanjing, a move that will upgrade the city's information-based services in an all-round way, boost the efficiency of public transport services and improve people's travel well-being, the map said.
In the past, anxious scenes of waiting for a bus were staged almost daily at a bus stop.
It is difficult to predict the running time of the buses, the condition of the buses along the routes and the location of the vehicles, and the problem of the pain points of the buses need to be solved urgently, especially in some big cities, where the commute distance is long and the traffic conditions are complicated in the morning and evening rush hours, which makes it difficult to ensure the punctuality rate of the buses.
To this end, Nanjing Intelligent Transportation joined hands with Gold Map to explore the new direction of "Internet+Traffic" civilian service, launched the first batch of "Internet+Intelligent Station" this intelligent service project.
The country's first Internet+smart station cards have landed in Nanjing, combining Gaud's big data with Gaud's vehicle-expected time ETA algorithm, and relying on the public transportation electronic station cards and mobile Internet, traffic data upgrades to achieve the "bus smart station cards + electronic maps" of both ends of the release of public transportation routes, bus estimated arrival time and other capabilities.
Through the Internet + Smart Station Card, Nanjing residents can not only easily get the expected arrival time of the bus, understand the real-time location of the bus and a few stops away from the current station, but also can intuitively grasp the conditions of the bus route through the red, orange and green color, so that all the bus routes through the site can be seen in real-time.
Thanks to the "Internet+Intelligent Station Card" technology, Nanjing residents have implemented such convenient and efficient public transportation modes as "searching the public transportation location before going out, mastering the station time when waiting for the public transportation, and knowing the arrival time when taking the public transportation".
According to the real-time public transportation information of the Internet + Smart Station Card, we can choose the route that suits us best. At the same time, we can do well in our psychological expectation and reduce the anxiety of waiting for the bus, thus making the journey more convenient and easy.

Xinhua Time Review: Unswervingly Go Our Own Way
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the correct path of development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the historical choice and the people's choice that China follows the path of development that suits itself.
In modern times, in the environment of poverty, weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent scholars to explore the way to save the country and save the people up and down to seek, go on and on.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have been thought about and tried, the results are not feasible."
It was not until the Communist Party of China and New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road China has taken is the road to happiness for the Chinese people, the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the road to common development between China and the rest of the world.
It is by following the right path that China can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and in line with the demands of the times, will show more and more bright prospects with the times.
Looking back on the past, the Chinese people are well aware of how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
Chinese people understand the truth of southern orange and northern briers, understand that suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves, only suitable for their own is the best.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that attracts worldwide attention.
In the tortuous course of mankind's advance, the "conclusion of history" has been known for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "conclusion of history", the collapse of the "China collapse theory" and the failure of the "socialist defeat theory".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving national prosperity and strength, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and ethnic groups in the world who wish to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a path of development that suits their national conditions.
Rather than "importing" the foreign model or "exporting" the Chinese model, China will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with other countries in governing the country and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old worker by text message because he preferred to hire staff from Asian backgrounds, a practice he lashed out at as “shameful”.
The committee said the way Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, who has worked at Wa<unk> Wagga's for more than 20 years, treated employees was "very unfair" and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the commission that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang used to advertise in various Chinese-Australian employment forums".
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said "first Asian lady" and the other said "first Asian employee".
The third post said he was "more inclined to overseas people" .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April, later citing her absence and allegedly a small cash shortfall on the cash register ranging from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reason for dismissing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
She has been absent for only one flight in three years and the "missing amount" adds up to several Australian dollars.
Ms. Ayton's dismissal, he said, had "actually nothing to do with her conduct or performance".
"It seems to me that, supported by evidence from Mr. Wang's job advertisement, the respondent's real motivation for sacking her is his preference for hiring people with Asian backgrounds," he said.
According to article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct constitutes ostensibly a violation of the Anti-Discriminatory Act and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant."
Sams said Mr. Wang's "horrifying" treatment of Ms. Ayton made it inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker who earns A$26 an hour.
Given possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the committee's supervisor to consider whether Mr Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang didn't give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged dismissal, he said.
"I believe that the respondent has resorted to irreparable and unfair and biased procedures to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang has "waited" this opportunity, which, in his view, will 'prove' the validity of terminating the employment of the applicant," he said.
"He was wrong ... the respondent dismissed the applicant in total disregard of any natural and impartial treatment accorded to her and, astonishingly, his rude and grossly unjust perfunctory behaviour."
Mr Sams said that although Foodworks was a small business, "it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss employees in such an unfair and perfunctory manner as admitted in the case."
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

He immigrated to the U.S. at the age of eight, helped clean the floor at a barber's and began taking up scissors at the age of 12 to ease the financial strain, CNN reported.
Although Mancini attended elementary school at the time, he did not graduate.
Robert, the son of Mancini, said his father loved his job and people from all over the world liked him, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to go to work six weeks before he died because he planned to come back for a haircut when he got better.
Robert, 82, said he must now find a new hairdresser after his father's death because he spent his life asking his father to help him cut his hair.
China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007]
In order to stabilize the company's share price and maintain its image, listed companies have been repurchasing shares frequently in the past two years, hoping to send the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market through directed repurchase and collective bidding transactions, thus stabilizing the share price and enhancing investor confidence.
Share repurchase funds for listed companies in 2017 amounted to 7.9 billion yuan, jumping to 51 billion yuan in 2018, according to Choice, the Eastern Wealth.The total repurchase funds for listed companies in A-shares have exceeded 100 billion yuan since population planning, a record amount of A-share repurchase funds, far higher than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the repurchase shares of the company seem to be the same as that of the major shareholders, but there are great differences in the implementation subject, source of funds, purpose of repurchase and equity of the shares themselves.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Mike Rong Information Consulting Co., told the Securities Daily that the "Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares" issued in November 2018 had been revised to address problems existing in the current system, such as narrow repurchase scope, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the "Rules for the Implementation of Share Repurchase by Listed Companies", which broadened the sources of funds for the repurchase of listed companies, simplified the implementation procedures appropriately, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership plans.
After the publication of the opinion, listed companies for share repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, repurchase process simpler, share repurchase enthusiasm is greater.
Repurchase of shares in a relatively low position also helps listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, raising the return on net assets, and easing the pressure on earnings indicators.
Compared with the majority shareholders, the repurchase of shares of listed companies is of greater significance and reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervaluation of share prices is the main factor in the repurchase of listed companies, the company's share prices can no longer reflect the company's future development prospects, so such companies are worthy of investors' attention, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the earnings report of such listed companies and the specific operating conditions.
Listed companies with large-scale buy-backs at least demonstrate the company's confidence in development and financial strength.
The growing repurchase enthusiasm of A-share listed companies has also normalized repurchase activity, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchase this year and industry-leading companies have become the mainstay of the repurchase market.
China Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying the company had repurchased 57.59 million shares of A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total equity, through a concentrated bidding exercise, and had paid a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs).
Yili shares have already paid $5.792 billion for share repurchase and have recently adjusted the use of repurchase shares from the original plan that “repurchase shares will all be used as a source of stock incentives for late implementation” to “accumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million will be used as a source of stock incentives and the remaining 30.49 million will be written off to reduce registered capital”.
Mr Yili said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would further improve earnings per share and earnings per share, effectively raising returns on investment by shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a repurchase progress announcement showed that the total repurchase of 3.59 percent of the company's shares, a total of 1.65 billion yuan.
TCL's board office told the Securities Journal that the repurchase shares would be used for employee ownership plans, equity incentives or convertible corporate bonds issued by publicly traded companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, constantly improving competitiveness, sustained and healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the protection of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the secondary market in the past year and taking into account factors such as the company's operating conditions and financial position, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to repurchase the company's shares.
'On the one hand, the repurchase of shares by listed companies can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies,' said Yang Delong, former chief economist of the Sea Open Source Fund.
Repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially high-performance shares. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through repurchase of shares, and it is worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and Hu Henghua, secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee (CPC) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) of the People's Republic of China (CPC) of China (CPC) of China (CPC) of the People's Republic of China (CPC) of China (CPC) of China (CPC).
In Changsha to build the world's leading industrial cluster of construction machinery, in the current fashion, is to create "the strongest surface. "
As the capital city of inland provinces, Changsha shouts out this bravado. Where does the spirit come from?
By the power of the bullying side leak.
The four Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue have achieved success, covering the whole fields of sky, underground, sea and land: the intelligent light aircraft of Shanhe River, the concrete conveying pump of Zhonglian Heavy Branch, the all-ground crane of Trinity Heavy Industries, and the tunnel shield machine of Railway Construction Heavy Industries.
Once upon a time, China had little say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
Time flies, Chinese enterprises 鈥渋ntroduce鈥? 鈥済oing out鈥?double-wheel drive, take advantage of the east wind of the 鈥渋ntroduction鈥?advocacy, take over, merge and set up factories in a variety of ways, and become the forerunners in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, the leading enterprises in construction machinery, such as Trinity Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Branch, Railway Construction and Heavy Industries, and Shanhe Intelligence, have already led the similar enterprises by a large margin in major economic indicators such as output value, market share and sales.
It's the camera that drives the momentum.
The "Four Great Diamonds" of the Xiang Army of Construction Machinery is the leading industrial cluster of Changsha Construction Machinery Industry and the head enterprise of the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industry's quacks and lakes, who can survive, and live well, is the stiffness of speech.
In early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturers have collapsed, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturers "cat winter" as a "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the industrial restructuring, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only survived the past, but also strengthened the body.
With all the stars praising the moon of the government and enterprises to work together.
The development of superior industries requires not only enterprises to be aggressive, but also the government to act actively.
Changsha enjoys the reputation of being the capital of construction machinery because it brings together the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many clusters of related industries, and greatly reduces the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving the supporting services and simplifying the examination and approval procedures.
Good business ecology, so that construction machinery manufacturing enterprises poured in.
History has pushed Changsha to the foreground of building the world's leading construction machinery. Time and tide wait for no man.
Both governments, enterprises, and even related industry, education and research firms should seize the opportunity to keep up with the times, set goals and make continuous efforts to contribute Hunan's strength to the building of a strong manufacturing country.

Qingyang, Gansu Province: Huyang carrying "poverty relief scriptures. "
September autumn renders the Loess Plateau.
Shaville, a 58-year-old villager at Yimin Farming Co-operative in the town of Yima, fills the sheepfold with the last shovelful of grass and watches the white lake sheep munch.
"It's delicious. You can't get a good price until you get fat in autumn and winter. "
He says he feeds sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, regularly cleans them up, sterilizes them, and treats them with great care.
She kept sheep for more than 20 years and didn't know how extensive sheep used to be until she came to work in a co-operative society.
Xia Weili is a resident of Xia Waterlogging Pool Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of scattered sheep, poor quality sheep, small quantity.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 impoverished people from the village joined the co-operative society, and everything began to change.
Shaville spent the whole day digging into farming, for he was always suffocating.
The shareholders were all poor households, trusting the sheep to the co-operatives, and counting on him whether they could pay dividends or sell them at the end of the year.
Fortunately, under the guidance of a technician, he gradually learned to do epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, became one of the village's few breeding "good handle. "
The Yimin Farming Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheep shelters and nearly 1,400 lakes and sheep.
Cooperatives in charge of Zou Tao said, standardized sheep shed inside and outside, there are doorways.
"The wool is thick and bacteria-prone, the lakes sheep can't stay in stuffy and damp places, the sheep shed must be built in a ditch on three sides, and a ventilator must be installed to ventilate and dissipate the heat."
Zou Tao said, in order to prevent the epidemic, also need to regularly sheep shed spray disinfection, sheep in the first quarter three to four anti-epidemic injections.
Besides living well, Little Sheep has to eat a mixture of silage corn, straw, alfalfa, and a wide enough playground to stretch its muscles.
Cooperatives adopt a trusteeship approach to guide local farmers to put good breeding lakes and sheep here, raise, manage and sell them in a unified manner, and achieve good breeding, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep in shares receive more than 6,000 yuan (US$1,600) a year in bonuses.
In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat and sheep farming is more than just a change in feeding patterns. The patterns of leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers have changed the scene of sheep farming on hillsides and selling sheep in markets, overcoming the weaknesses of traditional farming and animal husbandry, and the poor farmers' days have become better because of the modernization of sheep farming.
If market prices are weak, Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., a leading local company, will buy at a market-protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks, Zou said.
Xu Jianfeng, chief adviser to Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd. in Gansu Province, said the company has driven more and more poor households to read the scriptures by providing loan guarantees, sheep farming, order farming, quotation acquisitions and unified processing and sales services to poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 impoverished families have achieved steady increases in income through "joint" Zhongsheng farming and animal husbandry forage farming, breeding of good seeds, large-scale farming, slaughter division and marketing.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry crisscross zone, rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale farms and cooperatives for meat and sheep in the city, with more than 5 million meat and sheep, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter scale have been built.
France's finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit
LONDON (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revitalize the sluggish economy, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemaire said the ECB's latest monetary easing creates an opportunity for governments of countries that can afford to invest more.
The ECB cut interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to restart debt purchases to drive down borrowing costs in hopes of boosting economic recovery and inflation.
"Low interest rates will not restore prosperity to Europe and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient, " Mr Lemaire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until things get worse, " he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, giving a big boost to its economic growth.
Germany, which relies on exports, bears the brunt of the loss of momentum in the global economy.
Lemel noted that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in tax breaks.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros over a five-year period, with the rate falling from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent.

The U.S. National Healthy Diet Index rose slightly but remained a challenge - China New Net
The U.S. government's Healthy Diet Index has risen modestly over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new study.
But with a full mark of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at the University of Tafts in Massachusetts and co-author of the study, said Americans still eat too much food that causes heart disease, diabetes and obesity, the most common diseases among Americans.
The study appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Thursday.
The study was based on the U.S. government's health survey of 44, 000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "significant dietary challenges persist despite considerable improvements".
The challenges include cutting back on snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter and other saturated fats.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats rose from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended 10 percent limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a drop in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but still too high.
Officials say sugar intake should be less than 10% in your diet.
The researchers linked the decline in sugar intake to reduced consumption of sweet sodas, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adults in the U. S. consumption of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains increased slightly.
However, the 2016 figures show that these foods still account for less than 5 percent of the diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and a drop in fruit juices leading to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang says they still account for as much as 42 percent of the calories per day, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biannual personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they've eaten in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's guidelines for Americans recommend a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seeds that provide protein.
The number of Americans with diabetes almost doubled during the survey, to more than 7 percent, and the obesity rate has increased over many years - about 70 percent of American adults are now overweight or obese.

China Railway Tunnel Shaft Record Sets New Record
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) (Xinhua) (Zhang Weiming Xu Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day-and-night construction, the construction of shaft No.1 of the Korigongshan Tunnel on the Dali (Li) Railway was completed on Sept. 27, with the shaft reaching a depth of 762.59 meters below the ground, setting a record for the deepest shaft of a Chinese railway tunnel in the face of flooding.
The 34.5 km-long tunnel is located in Yunnan Province. The tunnel crosses the Gaoligong Mountains from the Jiangxi coast of Wrath and is the longest one-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel, which runs through 19 fault zones with a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction because it covers almost all possible hazards and geological hazards.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan Tunnel. It shoulders the important task of increasing the working surface to realize "long tunnel short tunnel" and later railway operation ventilation.
The successful excavation of shaft No.1 marks the formal entry of the Ko Lai Kung Shan Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction. After the excavation of the underground car park and the replacement of equipment, four additional working surfaces can be added to the underground tunnel to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The shafts are all in granite formations, because there are so many fissures in the granite formations that they can't stop the flow of water.
Zhao Si, chief engineer of the Darui Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that the shaft construction, many times occurred mud inrush, collapse and other dangerous situations, the builders invited experts on-the-spot pulse, more than 20 times to discuss the treatment plan.
"The maximum inrush of water in the shaft is over 300 cubic meters per hour and over 700 meters deep at the bottom of the shaft, and the pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep.
"If we don't pump water in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters an hour. Almost 85 percent of the time is spent treating water and 15 percent of the time is spent digging," he said.
In order to overcome the geological problems such as longitudinal joint development, mud inrush and water-rich granite in shaft No.1, a systemic water control measure combining exploration, injection and excavation is adopted to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of shaft No.1 has formed a mechanized assembly line, such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch hoisting system.
Finally, after more than 1200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the 762.59 meters depth excavation.
The 330-kilometer-long Darui railway is an important part of China-Myanmar international corridor and an important transport infrastructure for the construction of the 鈥渋nfrastructure鈥?
When completed and opened to traffic, the driving time between Dali and Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours on the current highway to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan region and promote economic and trade cooperation and people-friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Does Mr. Ma play for the By-election of Dundee National Assembly in Johor?
Ma Hua General Director Nasri Wei Jiaxiang: " The Supreme Council of the National Front to discuss! "
Dundee by-election is imminent and whether Ma Hua, a member of the National Front Party (FRODEBU), has joined the traditional national seat is a cause for concern.
However, after the meeting of the Central Committee of the Malaysian Communist Party (CPC), the Supreme Council of the National Front (FRODEBU) announced that it would leave the traditional seat to decide whether to continue to be replaced by Ma Hua.
Mr. Wei, who chaired the meeting of the Malaysian Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, told the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs), i.e. through a meeting of the FRODEBU's Supreme Council.
He said the Supreme Council of the FRODEBU is scheduled to meet in early October because the Electoral Commission will not meet until next Monday to finalize the by-election for the Dundee seat.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with National Front Chairman Na Governor Sri Amuzashi, and we all agreed on the need to seize the seat from the Alliance of Hope.
"We have decided to convene a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front (FRODEBU) in early October, and the heads of the FRODEBU's tripartite parties will determine which party is in action.
Asked if Mr. Ma would stick to the traditional seat of the Supreme Council of the FRODEBU, Mr. Wei reiterated that as President of the FRODEBU, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures. Therefore, any decision must be agreed upon by the FRODEBU.
"In any by-election, it is not uncommon for people to be willing to go on the campaign, and for political parties and parties to think that they should come out. "
"The most important thing is what kind of organisation and political union are we from?
"This is a great test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the FRODEBU has carried some valuable values along the way. "
"In the process, it's not surprising that someone might say something. "
"But once the FRODEBU Supreme Council has made a decision, it is most valuable that everyone must be fully prepared for war. "
In any event, Mr Wei said Mr Ma would make every effort to prepare for the upcoming by-election at three levels, namely, district councils, state councils and the Central Committee.

A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, has been ordered to " compulsory mountain patrol "
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced to hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan (RMB, the same below) for damages to the ecological resources and environment.
Because the defendant's family is poor, the procuratorial organ uses substitute labor to compensate the cost of ecological restoration, and realizes the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Baokang County Procuratorate Deputy Attorney General Wang Zhongliang said on the 27th, through three months of "voluntary mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, defendant Zhou Mou and wild macaques have established deep feelings, and before hunting animals deeply self-reproach.
On June 21 this year, Baokang County Prosecutor's Office filed a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit in the field of ecological resources, which was heard publicly in the county courts and pronounced on the spot.
Defendant Zhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, four years' probation and a fine of 3,000 yuan, and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan for damages to the environment caused by ecological resources.
According to investigation, since late January 2014 Zhou has set up a power grid in the cliffs, has hunted more than 20 wild animals, including antelopes, small chamois, fur-crown deer and so on.
The wildebeest belongs to the second-class endangered wildlife of the country, and the small chamois and fur-crown deer are listed in the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his unlawful facts and conduct, and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
However, considering Zhou's poor economic situation, under the coordination of Baokang County Prosecutor's Office, the local village committee, forest station and Zhou reached a tripartite agreement on the cost of alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration: that is, Zhou provided public welfare labor to offset the cost of ecological restoration through domestication and management of macaques, voluntary mountain patrolling and forest protection for one year in the village macaques reserve.
At the prosecutor's suggestion, the court agreed that Zhou's suspension of sentence should be accompanied by an active commitment to "substitute labor compensation for the cost of ecological restoration" .
At present, Zhou has been in the macaque sanctuary volunteer labor for 3 months, active mountain patrol, good performance.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has, in practice, organically integrated procuratorial functions with social governance, and scientifically used such methods as inspection proposals, investigation supervision and litigation supervision to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts by judicial means.
UN presents Earth Guardian Award for Ant Forest
Amid loud applause and loud music, the head of the Ant Forest project, Xu Di, and his user representative, Shen Junliang, stepped onto the podium to receive the U.N. Earth Guardian trophy in Piggy's hands.
The Ant Forest project, which brought hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental campaigns through small programs on mobile phones, was named the "Encouragement and Action Award" at the Earth Guardian Awards ceremony in New York on Tuesday.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the winners a week ago at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.
"The Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that has put hundreds of millions of people on the move to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what human beings can do for the environment," UNEP Executive Director Ian Annouson told Xinhua.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in the efforts to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
Launched on Alipay in August 2016 by the China Ant Financial Services Group, users "plant trees" on their mobile phones by recording low-carbon activities such as green travel in their daily lives and paying for utilities online.
Each time a user develops a virtual tree, Ant Forest and its partners plant a real tree in a desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million Ant Forest users had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and 122 million trees had been planted in desertified areas.
Costa Rican President Carlos Alwaleedo praised the ant forest's contribution to the award of the Earth Guardian Award, which was presented on the spot for his country's environmental efforts. "It's impressive to inspire so many people to participate in green action.
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ant King Service, said the Earth Guardian award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Mr Jing said the “ant forest” had affected 500m people over the past three years and the goal for the next three years was to involve 1bn people worldwide in low-carbon operations.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers' income from green hills and rivers.
Besides providing employment opportunities by planting trees, it also hopes to help farmers to increase their income through agricultural product development projects and electricity generation platforms.
"An ant forest" creates the public welfare environmental protection model based on digital technology also successfully went to sea, by other countries to learn from.
In June, GCash, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
GCash, along with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental charities, plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, it said.
The Earth Guardian Award, the highest award in the field of environmental protection in the United Nations, is presented annually.
" Ant Forest" is the third consecutive year that China's Green Innovation Project has won the "Encouragement and Action Award" after China's Saihanba Forest Farm Builder, China's Zhejiang Province's "Thousand Villages Demonstration and Wancun Remediation Project".
Economic and trade frictions affect the "report card" of the US economy.
Growth in US gross domestic product slowed markedly from the previous quarter as a result of a sharp drop in private sector investment and exports, according to the second quarter of this year's economic report.
Analysts cited economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they created as the main cause of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, equal to the revised figures previously released, but significantly lower than 3.1 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
Figures show that consumption growth was a major driver of growth in the U. S. in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 percent in the current quarter, boosting growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption spending and investment have driven economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down 1.16 percentage points of growth in the current quarter; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter; and net exports dragged down 0.68 percentage points of growth in the current quarter.
Far from sustaining last year's growth, private sector investment has fallen sharply, according to Barry Knapper, managing partner at Enside Macroeconomic Consulting, a US-based consultancy, as economic frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital spending is still expected to decline next year, according to Mr.
Analysts believe there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainties they create have undermined consumer confidence and adversely affected the outlook for US consumption, despite strong support from consumer growth in the second quarter.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a record for a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who led the survey.
Analysts generally believe the U. S. economy will continue to slow in the future.
But experts say the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions ease.
Carlin Burch, global economist at the British Economists think tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend so far this year, slowing to a much lower rate than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analysts, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow at 2.3 percent this year and slow further to 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic and trade frictions don't escalate further.
'The biggest concern is the trade and economic disputes and the uncertainties they create,' says Ellen Hazen, investment manager at Patnam Investments. 'If the trade and economic disputes are resolved, the uncertainties will be greatly reduced and the industry sector will perform much better than it does now.
Matt Merry, equity strategist at Miller-Tabarker Asset Management, said the economic and trade frictions remained a "first priority" and a major cause of this year's volatility in U.S. capital markets, and whether the economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to affecting the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off each year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is the embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights and an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
At the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on September 27, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote.
This is the first provincial level in Ningxia to formulate a comprehensive system to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women's local regulations, will be implemented as of November 1, 2008.
The Regulations, which were revised on the basis of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women" in Ningxia in 2007, are divided into 9,65 articles, including general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, rights and interests in labor and social security, property rights and interests, personal rights and interests, marriage and family rights and interests, legal responsibilities and supplementary provisions.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of parental leave for couples, which is the first in China.
In April this year, the Guidance Notes on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children under 3 Years of Age issued by the General Office of the State Council gave a description of couples' joint parenting.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has put forward an innovative proposal to "encourage the employing units to give joint parental leave of 10 days each year to couples who have children in conformity with laws and regulations between the ages of zero and three".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the current compilation of the right to personality in the Civil Code of China, and stipulates in detail the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits frequent sexually assaulted girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and preventive work as a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Regulations explicitly stipulates women's right to know about the common property of marriage and family and their obligations to the property registration organs and other relevant bodies, and provides firm institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also prohibits indirect discrimination in relation to sex discrimination in employment, a hot topic in society.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation's Public Inspection and Law Department and civil affairs departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing social professionals to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and the anti-domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize this and promote it.In many laws and regulations, people's governments at or above the county level are encouraged to mobilize social forces and accumulate social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and people's governments at or above the county level are required to provide steady and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Academician Yuan Longping of Xing'an Alliance of Inner Mongolia Workstation of Saline-tolerant Alkali-tolerant Rice
Reporter 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xing'an UNITA Administrative Office learned that the recent "Xing'an UNITA Academician Yuan Longping's workstation on-the-spot inspection and acceptance of saline-alkali-tolerant rice," good news, saline-alkali-tolerant rice average per mu yield of more than 1000 jin.
An expert group of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Areas collected and harvested the "Xingyan Series" rice on the spot.
The average yield of saline-tolerant alkaline rice per mu was 508.8 kg on land with a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity of 5 to 6 per thousand.
"Our next step is to innovate on the basis of this year's experiments," said Wang Shigang, executive director of the workstation of Academician Yuan Longping of UNITA. "We also need to reform and re-cultivate and optimize the saline-tolerant alkaline rice varieties so as to make them of better quality and higher yield."
"On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that by continuously strengthening scientific and technological efforts, saline-tolerant alkaline rice will continue to perform miracles on saline-alkali land," said Lai Yongcai, associate dean and researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Xing'an alliance belongs to the southern foothills of Daxing'anling concentrated continuous piece of special hardship area.
Academician Yuan Longping's workstation was unveiled by UNITA in October 2004.
Prof. Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and popularization of the newly cultivated hybrid saline-tolerant rice varieties and advanced technology, and to build a 960-acre base of saline-tolerant alkaline rice in the right-wing flag of Horqin.
The on-site yield measurement of saline-tolerant alkaline rice not only provides a scientific basis for raising low- and medium-yield fields in Xing'an Alliance to inject hope into medium-high-yield fields, but also for planting saline-alkali rice under the same conditions in China.
After marathon debates and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed the abortion law on Sept. 26, local time, the Australian Web site reported.
The bill is understood to have sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with serious divisions within the Liberals since independent lawmaker Alan Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, Australia's Senate voted 26 to 14 on Tuesday night to legalize abortion, making it the third longest-running bill in the New State Senate, the newspaper said.
Abortion was legalized in the New State on the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the House of Representatives.
The law allows women to terminate their pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, allow women to abort later in pregnancy.
The Senate on Tuesday night approved an amendment that would allow doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of hospital advisory committees before performing abortions for women 22 weeks after their pregnancy.
In addition, the Senate's amendments include the need for doctors to provide adequate care for babies who survive the termination of pregnancy.
The new governor had faced public criticism from conservatives for the bill, which she stepped in several times to buy more time for debate, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to take the time to manage the entire new state, " she said in defence of her absentee ballot.
Australia's Liberal MP, Davids, is understood to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, which threatened to withdraw from the state government, saying it triggered a "government crisis".
But then Davis gave in.
"The contents of the amendments to the Abortion Legalization Act introduced to the House of Representatives on the morning of 26 actually provide more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, Australia's New State party leader, Barry Laroe, says he is proud to be part of a government that legalizes abortion.
"Our achievements last night were historic for the New State, legalizing abortion, making abortion no longer a criminal offense, nor treating aborted women as criminals.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state capital to enrich social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, bringing the total transfer of state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said.
Liu Kun made the remarks at the task deployment meeting of the National Social Security Fund, which was jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security and the SASAC on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full reflection of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system, as well as a policy measure based on the current and long-term consideration."
In 1992, the State Council issued the "Implementation Programme for Transferring Partial State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds", which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of transfers of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been completed, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about $860.1 billion.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions performing the functions of investors by the Ministry of Finance has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer work of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, transferring 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preparatory work for the first transfer, laying the foundation for the implementation of the next transfer.
According to a notice issued jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-funded Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds by the central and local governments will be fully launched in 2008, and will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the full deferral of the transfer exercise.
It was emphasized that the transfer should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Tight working hours and heavy tasks.
Liu said all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, push forward the work solidly and grasp the transfer policy content accurately, strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-funded Transfer and Enrichment of Social Security Fund Starting from the point of "enrichment of the Social Security Fund's purse", the goal is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author thinks that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice Concerning the Comprehensive Deferral of the Work of Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund, clarifying the timetable for transferring part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, i.e. the work of transferring part of state-owned capital from the central and local governments to enrich social security funds, which will be fully deferred in 2006.
After the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10 percent of its shares in ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of over 115 billion yuan.
As financial investors, social security funds and other undertaking bodies enjoy the rights of income, disposal and information assigned to state-owned shares.
ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China in the announcement said that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author thinks that similar transfer of shares in state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations. "
The "additional results" of the first step in the transfer of some state-owned enterprises to social security can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people and the sharing of development achievements by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, most of the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are in important industries and fields in China's economy.
Among them, the leading enterprises are to continue to achieve greater and greater strength.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided to put aside the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated that it would do a good job of deferring the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in an all-round way in accordance with the arrangements made at the executive meeting of the State Council, thus fully reflecting the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises by the whole people.
The second step in the transfer of the "additional results" is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security funds, further consolidate the pension social security system foundation.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure. Most of the state-owned enterprises transferred as the main body have the ability to make profits and pay dividends continuously, which can not only effectively replenish the social security funds, but also provide the source of the social security funds.
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of deposits of enterprises' basic old-age insurance can be reduced by one percentage point.
The third step in the rotation "additional results" is to add stabilizers to the capital markets.
This transfer undertakes the main way to obtain income is " dividend-based, transport as an auxiliary" .
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, social security funds are mainly earned from equity dividends.
However, as a value investor of capital market, social security fund has strong capability of capital operation.
As far as listed assets in state-owned capital are concerned, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which is conducive to raising the level of business operations of listed companies and exerting a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase of equity ownership is conducive to further strengthening its influence in the market, and plays the role of "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is beneficial to give full play to the function of "value discovery" of institutional investors and guide them to invest rationally and invest in value.

Iran Confirms Advanced Centrifuge Suspension of Implementation of Iranian Nuclear Accord
Iran violates Iranian nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Monday.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iranian nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of U.S. President Trump from the Iranian nuclear agreement in May 2018, the resumption and tightening of Iranian sanctions.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its uranium enrichment stockpile below 300 kg and its uranium enrichment purity below 3.67 per cent.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran would have only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, while allowing only a small number of more advanced models to be used for research without producing enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for nuclear bombs.
"On 25 September, IAEA confirmed that advanced centrifuges of Iranian R&D model 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium," the report said.
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency reported to Member States on the 26th, a diplomatic official responded: "They [Natanz uranium enrichment] facilities are busy. "

Italy's education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect people's health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, education minister for Italy's new cabinet and a member of the five-star movement, has moved to parliament to introduce a new tax policy on sugary drinks, snacks and airfares.
According to reports, under a bill introduced by education minister Fiora Monti, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on health hazards such as sugary drinks and snacks, as well as an environmental tax on air tickets, a euro on domestic flights and a euro1.5 tax on international flights.
Mr Fioramonti said the government expects to receive 3bn euros in taxes through a series of seemingly small tax measures.
The proceeds from the tax will be available in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.
Prime Minister Conte said he thought it was a workable option, while Italian lawmakers, European MPs and coalition leader Silvio Berlusconi wrote sarcastically, "Please hide desserts, biscuits, bread and candy as soon as possible because the new government will start imposing a snack tax.
The snack tax generally refers to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-calorie foods, the report said.

China-ASEAN relations have been steadily upgrading and continuously upholding mutual respect, understanding, trust and support, thus effectively promoting regional peace, stability and prosperity.
The fundamental reason for the development and change of New China in the past 70 years is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), have initiated and developed the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, Xiao said.
This road conforms to the trend of the times, conforms to China's national conditions, profoundly changes the destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and contributes greatly to world and regional peaceful development.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
(New China 70 Years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper said that with China's overall national strength and rapidly growing international influence, some people around the world are worried that China will follow the path of "powerful and hegemonic" and some are proposing what it calls "China Threat Theory".
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-seated prejudices, and psychological imbalances caused by power dissipation, as well as deliberate distortions of self-serving vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity and strength, national rejuvenation and people's well-being is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, that China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth, that China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new momentum into world economic growth, and that the role of China's economic stabilizer and power source will become more prominent in the future.
At present, the world economic growth power is insufficient, sound China's economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to economic growth.New industrialization, information technology, urbanization and agricultural modernization have been accelerated, the economic structure has been deeply adjusted, industrial optimization has been continuously upgraded, and new economic growth points have been emerging.
"The study by the McKinsey Institute for Global Studies suggests that by 2040, China's integration with the rest of the world's economies is expected to generate between $22 trillion and $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26 percent of the global economy.
The white paper stressed that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes, deep integration.
China, with its more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term boon to the world economy.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to see China's economic development as a "threat" nor a "challenge" and to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain so as to "decouple" China from the world economy.
The white paper noted that all-directional opening to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend" .
China has steadfastly pursued a win-win strategy of opening up to the outside world and achieved greater intensity and a higher level of opening-up.China has the most potential consumer market in the world, and China is the most attractive investment destination.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
A mutually beneficial two-way street will last for a long time.
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection,' the white paper said.
Only by working side by side can we create an open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced and win-win environment for development and jointly make the cake of development bigger and bigger, thus forming a mutually beneficial and win-win interest community.
The white paper points out that China offers more public goods to the international community.
Including promoting high-quality co-operation, setting up a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, but it has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations and provide the international community with more and better public goods.
In a written interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Slipnikov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said Russia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of trade and economic cooperation, further optimize the export structure and diversify Russian exports to China.
Russian exports to China account for a significant proportion of the forestry, machinery and chemical industries, while exports of agricultural products are important, including oil and fat products, meat products and dairy products, as well as grains, fish and seafood, he said.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-materials and non-energy products to China have also shown a sound and steady trend of development.
Speaking about optimizing Russia's export structure to China, he said Russia has set a target for expanding the export of high-tech products to meet the demand for high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will then refine financial and non-financial support measures to further increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
Russia is ready to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and develop cooperation with China in pharmaceuticals, aviation and other fields, he said.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He emphasized that Russian products in many areas were "quality superiority and price competitiveness" compared with similar Western products.
Turning to the two countries' goal of achieving a $200 billion bilateral trade volume by 2024, Mr. Slippernikov said areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemicals and forestry will play an important role in achieving that goal.
Russia intends to diversify its supply in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed Russia's intention to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China is one.
Manufacturers in Russia's agriculture, metallurgy, petroleum and natural gas, and chemical industries are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises by "establishing more Russian-Chinese joint ventures to jointly develop exports to third countries".
Russia's Export Center is adopting a variety of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support Russian exports to China, he said.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to facilitate more convenient access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and develop new types of export products to China.

Foreign Ministry responds to Taiwan's alleged "diplomatic breakthrough": covert self-degrading
China's foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular press conference on Tuesday that the move was disgraceful and amusing.
Taiwanese media reported that officials of the Taipei office in New York had entered United Nations Headquarters to attend a conference on religious issues in the United States, calling it a "diplomatic breakthrough".
The meeting you mentioned was a border meeting held by the United States on United Nations premises, not a meeting of the United Nations at all.
Geng said that Taiwanese personnel infiltrated the United Nations in a covert manner, degrading themselves and exaggerating that this was a so-called "diplomatic breakthrough", which was a disgraceful and generous gesture.
He pointed out that the UN has repeatedly reaffirmed its adherence to the one-China principle in handling the Taiwan question in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758.

Demonstration Bombards President Steps Down Egyptian Mountains and Rains The authorities have shown a strong crackdown
Twitter-themed labels and social media are touting Egyptians taking to the streets today to peacefully demand the ouster of President Susie.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Disapproval has virtually disappeared in Egypt since then-military chief Sessi seized power in a military coup in 2013 and any form of protest would be in extreme danger.
The Guardian reports that the Cairo NGO Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since a rare outbreak of protests over the weekend calling for Mr. Cecil's ouster.
Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday after allegations of corruption over Cecil and his family's extravagance in pursuit of vanity.
Egypt's interior ministry yesterday insisted it would confront any attempt to destabilize the country resolutely and not softly.
The heart of Cairo has long been heavily guarded, with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square, the Egyptian revolutionary detonation point in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces on the 25th detained a number of important scholars and social sages, including Cairo University political science professors, well-known columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cecil will be disastrous, " he wrote on the 24th.
"It is in Egypt's interest that he should step down immediately. "
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, a former Egyptian military chief of staff, was detained as a spokesman for Annan.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Cecil for the presidency.
Chairman of the Constitutional Party, Daoud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that sweeping away dissidents reflects government instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and middle classes are intensifying.
"The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears, " said the opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who ran for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been messed up by him and political oppression is widespread, Cecil is trying to convey a clear message to key generals and politicians who might be replaced.
Noll noted that while socioeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, the government's repressive approach will only increase public anger.
Now that the fear barrier has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Exiled Spanish businessman and actor Ali, a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began posting a series of films earlier this month that benefited from government corruption, setting off a small demonstration in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, Amrak, does not have to go through a legal tendering process to get lucrative contracts, stressing the corruption prevailing between the military and relatives of Cecil, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He felt deeply regretful that he had been involved in it.
Ali claimed that the sumptuous palaces and luxury hotels he helped cover were in stark contrast to Egypt's current abject poverty and had yet to be paid.
On Twitter, such topical labels as "Stand Up and You're Not Lonely", "Cersey You're Dead", "Cersey Rolls Out", and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets calling for people to take to the streets peacefully to demand Mr. Cecil's ouster.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarvik has nearly seven million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday, in an Arabic message, he said: " Cecil is doomed to die ... he is done, and his supporters are now making a big mistake."

Eligible trainees will receive a monthly training allowance of up to HK$4,000 upon completion of their courses.
Many boutiques in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong have few customers.
As a result of the recent social strife in Hong Kong, the number of visitors to Hong Kong has dropped considerably. Apart from the tourism industry, the hotel, catering and retail industries have been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Matthew Law Chi-kwong, and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Edward Yau, met with the media on entrusting the Employees Retraining Board with a special training programme and measures to support the tourism industry.
Mr Law said the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy were imminent and should not wait until the situation calmed down.
Hence, the HKSAR Government has launched a free training programme called "Special Value-added" .
People who have lost their jobs since June 1 or are required to take unpaid leave by their employers have the opportunity to join the Scheme as long as they meet the relevant requirements, the spokesman said.
Mr Law noted that the courses covered a wide range of topics, the most important of which was vocational skills training, covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering industries. There would also be innovative 鈥渋nnovative technology鈥?courses as well as cross-sectoral 鈥渃ommon skills鈥?courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, Mr Yu Pengchun, said all courses are free of charge and the scheme is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participants who have completed each full-time or part-time course and attended 80% of the courses will receive a special allowance up to HK$4,000 per student per month.
The two- to three-month training course is offered by about 50 training institutions and can be attended daily from October 3 to March 31, 2008. Each person can enroll up to four courses.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide it over.
These measures include relaxing grants to the Travel Industry Council, subsidising 6,000 tourist guides to renew their licences and exempting travel agents from annual fees.
Exercise tired people also tired brain?
The brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, according to a study of athletes conducted on the Russian satellite network.
The study, led by Dr. Marcel Perciglion, a specialist at the Pierre-Salpetre hospital in France, found an inconspicuous link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control over activity.
"You need to control pain in your muscles and joints and you can force yourself to stop the autonomous process, " explained Perciglion.
The study was conducted by the French National Institute of Sports (INSEP).
The school's experts are in charge of guiding athletes in preparing for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, that is, uncontrollable fatigue after high-burdened exercise, the body can not recover, performance decline.
INSEP raises the question of whether part of the reason for this condition is neurofatigue, which is caused by excessive mental work.
The study appears in the journal Current Biology.

Thailand, Egypt and 42 other countries and regions have unilaterally granted visa-on-arrival to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 other countries and regions, including Indonesia, have unilaterally granted visa-free access to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports.
In addition to visa-free, visa-on-arrival arrangements, Chinese citizens are also more convenient to apply for visas, more and more simplified procedures.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include a 10-year valid multiple visa exchange with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina, and a two-year multiple visa exchange with the United Kingdom for each other's travel, business and family visits.
France, Italy and Singapore have cut visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC Business Travel Card with multiple entry and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the card is equivalent to obtaining multiple five-year visas from 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great significance to business people, especially private enterprises.
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in terms of effective card holdings.

Two UHV Projects Launched on "One Interchange Always"
The quasi-east to southern Anhui ±1,100 kV HVDC transmission and Sutong 1000 kV AC UHVGIL integrated pipe corridor were put into operation on 26th.
Both of these projects occupy the high point of the current world transmission technology in their respective fields and will improve the large-scale optimization of energy allocation in China.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the State Energy Administration, said the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is the world's largest power transmission capacity, transmission distance from the longest transmission project.
It is of great significance to promote the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensure the power supply in eastern China.
Gas insulated metal sealed transmission lines.
Sutong pipe corridor project, set the GIL project in the world's highest voltage grade, the transmission capacity of the strongest record, the realization of the East China backbone power grid's highest voltage grade of the "AC double loop network" closed-loop operation.

With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost on the way, and the project has been developed to increase the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.
After the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is put into operation, 100 million degrees of electricity can be transferred every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of new energy absorption in Xinjiang.
At full capacity, it is estimated that the line alone will deliver between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to cover more than half of Shanghai's total electricity consumption.
Sutong GIL integrated pipe corridor project is a UHV AC loop network across the Yangtze River control project.
Using conventional overhead lines to cross the river requires the erection of two giant iron towers over 450 meters across the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island the size of a football field for each tower.
In this regard, the State Grid bold innovation, the development of compact ultra-high-voltage ACGIL transmission technology, through tunnels from underwater rivers, to avoid the impact on the gold channel.
The two projects have brought about new leaps and bounds in the manufacturing capability of electrical equipment in China.

New regulation to solicit opinions: social capital to obtain rural land management rights need to be qualified
Achievement of Rural Land Management Right by Social Capital Needs Qualification
Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights to Publicly Seek Opinions It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas (MOA) announced on its website yesterday the "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Draft Amendments for Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "Draft Amendments") to solicit opinions publicly, adding supervision and risk prevention to the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights.
The Draft Opinions will now be open to the public for comments.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas said that in order to implement the newly revised Law on Contracting for Rural Land, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "three-power separation" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas revised the "Measures for the Administration of Transfer of Contracted Management Right to Rural Land" and formed the "Draft of Opinions".
Beijing Youth Daily reporters understand that the first published "Draft of Opinions" a number of important revisions.
The newly revised Law on the Contracting of Rural Land clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of separation of three powers, and sets up special sections on the assignment, exchange and transfer of land contracted management rights (lease, subcontract, shareholding or other forms) respectively.
In this draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of separation of powers, effectively respond to the essence of the revision of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and take into account the great differences between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange of land contracting and management rights, the revised draft defines the transfer scope in terms of parties, procedures and supervision, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, including the transfer of leases and shares, and changes the title of the Regulations from the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights to the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights.
Measures for the transfer and exchange of land contracted management rights will be promulgated separately.
"Opinion" pointed out that in the "three powers separation" background, farmers shares in only a certain period of land management rights.
Theoretically speaking, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only risk losing their right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is legally unnecessary to require the return of the contracted land to the original contractor and conflicts with the Bankruptcy Law.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing land, preferred shares, leased shares, buy-back and so on have come into being in practice.
Considering that preferred shares have been discussed theoretically in the company law, it is suggested that it should be regarded as an advocacy regulation to guard against the risk of loss of shares.
