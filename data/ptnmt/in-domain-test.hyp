Women's volleyball hopes to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
China's men's volleyball team won the women's volleyball match against the Netherlands on Tuesday, winning two games in a row.
The World Cup is drawing to a close and China's women's volleyball team must not lose heart in the face of Serbia, despite the prospect of defending their title.
In the first two sets of the match against Holland, China's women's volleyball performance as always strong, 2519, 2516 respectively to the next two cities, until the third set, the team encountered setbacks.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened its attacking serve after falling behind. The Chinese team was hit by a pass and the girls' aggressiveness began to increase.
In an interview after the game Lang Ping also said: "The third inning because of mistakes we sent about 8 points. "
Of course, the Dutch women's volleyball strength is not to be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball before the Games also prepared for difficulties, although lost a game, but everything is still in the control of Lang Ping, "It is normal to lose and win against strong teams, five games is normal, so we told the players to concentrate, Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the status, Zhang Changning in the offensive opening fire, the singles to get 8 points, for the team winning great achievements.
The Chinese women's volleyball team, with only two rounds left in the 11th round of the competition, though it has already touched the championship trophy in one hand, did sound a warning bell against the Dutch team: the more critical a moment is, the more effort must be put into it.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and the U.S. women's volleyball team played five sets, the U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team as long as the match against Serbia three points, can advance a round to defend their title.
All sorts of things are moving in the direction of China's women's volleyball advantage.
However, while Serbia's absence from the top six does not mean they can easily hand over three points to China.
The current form of the table suggests Serbia is largely unlikely to win a medal, which means they can "lighten up" against China in the women's volleyball competition, putting down the baggage and hitting their opponents with all their might.
In addition, the Serbian substitute team is not "a lamb to be slaughtered" , the previous campaign with the Netherlands, the two sides fought five games, the Serbian team finally 3:2 reversed the Netherlands' main squad, which can be seen in its lineup thickness.
Before kick-off of the third stage, Lang Ping also said neither side could cope: "Osaka is going to be a very difficult game.
Now that the trumpet has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white heat stage. "
On the strength of the lineup, China's women's volleyball team are above their opponents, only the last critical juncture, but also to see whether the women's volleyball girls can play a normal level, in the field to release themselves.

He said: "Today, for the first time on a cruise, I was very excited and unforgettable to see the magnificence of the Xiangjiang River and feel the pulse of Changsha's development.

... span class='class1'>The republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary. The spotlights on all the media are flashing with images that we don't usually remember.
However, if the hero walks around, also seems to be ordinary as you as I.
... span class='class1'>Yuan Longping, devoted to rice research, has produced excellent seeds and cultivated the whole world, so that more than a billion people no longer have the danger of famine. He has made great achievements, and is often like an old peasant who likes to wander in the fields.
They, benevolent and benevolent, live simple, simple and persistent, as long as immersed in foreigners do not understand and they cherish their own business, very easy to be happy, do not care about the bridle, wealth and glory.
As in Jin Yong's novels, the sweeper of Shaolin Temple's Sutra Hall, though shocked by martial arts, is not dazzling, joyless and sad.
Every "sweeping monk" , every pair of abject-hearted, behind me has a homeland to give to whoever it is.
Our nation bears not only the shoulders of heroes, but also the palms of billions of people.
Once, a girl high school student's words, by the netizen crazy turn, "When the hero passes, there will always be someone sitting by the roadside applause ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be the person sitting by the roadside applause.
In fact, when the hero and give the hero applause, is not contradictory.
Roadside applause of people, also in the transmission of heat and light, they are also luminous body.
Ordinary as you are like me, in life there are always some opportunities, some moments, there is a cumulative, heroic shape.
Shanghai excellent judge Zou Bihua, shouldered the burden of judicial reform, but in the annual conference let the communicating room masters on the stage to tell their stories, a year of countless newspaper letters, from no error, "do simple things, is not simple," Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the "sweeping monk"-style old recipients.
It's a little bit of pity between heroes. One hero applauds another.
Sweeping monks have Shaolin Monastery, Yuan Longping has vast paddy experimental fields, Nanrendong has the "eye of the sky", Qinyi has stages, and Zhou Ruchang has lecture halls Whether we can be heroes depends not only on our own efforts, but also on a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, China's Heavenly Eye, now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological circles were still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Tzu-xin had not yet begun to write "Three Bodies" .
At that time, the bull's eye was the single-faced radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico, USA, the Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, considered the most insurmountable in the world.
At that time, the diameter of Chinese radio telescopes was less than one tenth that of other people's.
But Nan, who enjoys world - class research and salary, insists on returning with a near - mad idea of building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, to receive more messages from outer space.
China is a wasteland waiting to be rebuilt. Why invest so much money in stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, and the "eye of heaven" project begins happily.
It took 12 years to select the site and nine years to complete the project.
With the opening of the 500 - meter - diameter Heavenly Eye, China has achieved an unprecedented and "unique scientific project" in the world.
So, the "eye of heaven" is great, Nanrendong people are great, the Republic is big and stands tall.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have a chance to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes walked affably, there are people in the roadside gently applauded, such a beautiful country, very harmonious.

Chirac dies, political heritage endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac died on Tuesday at the age of 86.
At a time of unprecedented global upheaval, many of the political legacies of the French politician remain to be praised.
Chirac served as French president for 12 years in a highly charismatic manner.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of De Gaulleism and firmly supported European integration. He is the representative of pursuing the "European dream" .
At the same time, he also advocated world multipolarization and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of the statesman.
For this reason, the French media described him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Mr Chirac's fondest political decisions was to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to overcome the pressure of the United States, in the front ranks of the anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would exacerbate terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Subsequent facts proved that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is at a loss and U.S. unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the Golden Decade of Sino-French Relations. After being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and their bilateral exchanges entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation made breakthrough progress.
The Sino-French Cultural Year, initiated by Chirac, created a new mode of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's devotion to Chinese culture throughout his life was particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can recite some of Li Bai's and Du Fu's poems and even accurately date Chinese bronze wares.
"No one has really been to Egypt without looking at the pyramids, or China without looking at the terra cotta warriors" -- this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters, Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems resulting from China's economic growth and China's international political status.
But I personally have confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it build the concepts and values of harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The Spartans are gone, but the political legacy and revelation that Chirac left to the world will endure.

HKSAR Legislative Council Members Jointly Against US-related Bill
Some members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have expressed strong opposition to the passage of the "2020 Human Rights and Democracy Bill in Hong Kong" by the U.S. Senate House of Representatives, a joint statement said on Tuesday.
According to the statement, which was jointly prepared by 40 members of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's current rights under the Basic Law include maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, conducting business, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports with different countries and regions around the world in the name of "Hong Kong, China", and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in a wide range of related fields.
The statement said there was no need for the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass the bill, but only to respond to the call of its agents in Hong Kong to intervene roughly in Hong Kong's internal affairs and to seek political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong.
Congressional representatives expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the decision.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner of the United States and a source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's good rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the US passes this bill, it will not only hurt Hong Kong and its own interests, but also aggravate China-US relations.
The statement said that Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations effectively.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international business.
The two houses of parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week, the European Times reported Tuesday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently claimed that France could not "admit everyone" but tried to "admit them properly".
Reports say Mr. McClellan is trying to find a compromise on immigration issues to ease the impact of the upcoming debate.
In an interview during the general debate at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, he said he hoped there would be a genuine “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
He said: "If France wishes to be well accommodated, it cannot accommodate everyone".
He outlined four key points of immigration policy: the expeditious granting of asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection; the more efficient promotion of integration; the reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and the more efficient resettlement of persons illegally admitted into France who were not suitable for stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion.
Mr Malone said he hoped to be able to "evaluate" the system, but not to abolish it, but to limit it.
Following his remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National League, argued that his statement was "empty talk" .
Senate Speaker Lindsey Rusher, a right-wing Republican, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" manner, indirectly criticizing Mr.
On immigration, Mr Varo, a member of the left-wing Socialist party, said France should be "more receptive and better" and criticised Mr Malone for "manipulating" the issue.
The new asylum and immigration law, which was enacted a year ago, has divided opinion within the ruling party but failed to placate the right-wing opposition, the report said.
In the next election in 2022, immigration policy will again be the focus of extreme right-wing attacks, and Mr. Malone needs to do something about it, but at the risk of infuriating left-wing members of the ruling party.

According to financial data servicer Oriental Wealth, the total amount of A-share repurchase by listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same as below), a record high over the same period last year.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Rong Information Consulting Co., said the low overall valuation of A-shares this year and the relatively low price of repurchase of shares would help listed companies to improve the efficiency of their capital use, as well as demonstrate the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market capitalization and their ample cash flow, which would help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the stock repurchase system, also promoted listed companies to actively carry out stock repurchase.
Earlier this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for listed companies to buy back shares, providing detailed rules and guidelines for listed companies to buy back shares.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the repurchase plan so far this year are mainly in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing industries.
In addition, from the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies repurchase more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, at the top of the list is Yi Li shares, its repurchase of more than $5 billion.
What effect will the listed company's stock buyback have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice-dean of the Faculty of Finance and Economics of Renmin University of China, told China News Agency reporters that buybacks on the one hand show that listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial position, and are capable of maintaining stock price stability and giving investors confidence; on the other hand, they also show that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, to the market and to investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the core of the fundamentals.
Repurchase of stocks of listed companies is beneficial to investors'confidence and supports the price of stocks of listed companies.
According to the calculation of Oriental Securities Research, according to the total number of expected buybacks of A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year, and the average price of the transactions, this year's buybacks for the A-share market is expected to bring additional funds of up to 150 billion yuan.

Shandong original Shouguang county committee secretary Wang Boxiang -- Qiang county rich people Chizixin Xinhua
Born in February 1943, Wang Boxiang was born in Shandong Province.He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1967 and served as a Communist Party secretary, a county secretary and a mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed secretary of Shouguang county council in Shandong province, which was then a poor county in Weifang.
During his five years in office, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: first, promoting the industrialization of vegetables; secondly, developing the salt-and-alkali beach in Shouguang; and thirdly, laying the foundation for an industrial turnaround, so that Shouguang people from now on bulged their pockets and straightened their backs.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of vegetable cultivation and have also learned the lessons of vegetable cultivation.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers harvested a bumper crop of vegetables that failed to sell and rotted in the fields.
Wang Boxiang investigation found that the key to grasp vegetables is to make good circulation.
Shouguang was the first to set up a vegetable wholesale market, opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party cadres and cadres should take the lead, smashed, all losses in the county to bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuanzhu village, set up 17 winter-heated vegetable sheds.
Subsequently, a promotional group was set up in the county, and under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi guided the tours in the townships and villages.In the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable stalls were popularized, and the popularity of the stalls spread to the county and the whole country.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 160 million acres of land in addition to salt-alkali beach, is the shallow beach.
The local people live very hard.
Shou Nan vegetable shed, Shou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to hold a general battle, camped on the desolate alkali beach, a dry is forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres in the county ate and slept on the construction site, carrying burdens like migrant workers, feasting and sleeping outdoors, and the people saw them thumbs out in admiration.At that time, Shoubei had developed 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields and a treasure pot on the saline-alkali beach.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county committee.
During the meeting, a "Comparison table of industrial economic figures in 12 counties of Weifang City" was issued.
But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value of only $119 million, ranks third.
With more than 70 Buddhist missionaries, Wang Boxiang went out to "change his mind. "
Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, we have organized a "concerning group" to take lessons in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai every year.
Shouguang lacks enterprises, even less entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the special conference panel: open selection of factory managers throughout the county, 40 "enterprise-minded talents" to stand out, was pushed to the industrial front.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's 100 strong counties, Wang Boxiang transferred Weifang City Vice Mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 vegetable tents, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4.84 enterprises, more than 100,000 yuan households and cadres recognized by the common people.
On September 26, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a meeting of foreign ministers of China and African member states of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Foreign Ministers of Ce d'Ivoire, current members of the Security Council, Equatorial Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, Niger and Tunisia attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, strength comes from unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are being challenged, and the role of the United Nations is being undermined, to the detriment of the interests of the vast number of developing countries, including African countries and small and medium-sized countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, unity has strength.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand side by side, not just with four votes, but with other countries to follow up, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has set up the "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council.
Second, settle disputes by negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has successful mediation experience with African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly those in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
We should jointly make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and play the good offices and mediation role of the UN.
Third, self-improvement.
African countries and people know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa's hotspot issues, the Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and resolutely promote the capacity-building of African independent peace operations.
Fourth, development is fundamental to governance.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We must put economic and social development first and mutually support each other on the path of development they have chosen.
China is ready to work closely with the African Union's Agenda of 2063, the UN's Agenda for Sustainable Development of 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in African development.
China has already provided and will continue to provide full assistance, manpower and material assistance within its means, and is ready to coordinate action with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other countries to increase assistance, so as to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (Kim).

Wuhan boosts intellectualization of industrial enterprises and grants 20 million yuan in subsidies
Reporter 27 from the Wuhan Municipal Government Press Office held a series of "Celebrations to New China welcome the military games" city press conference, learned that this year, the city accelerated industrial intelligence transformation, and implemented a maximum of 20 million yuan transformation grant measures.
Up to now, more than 800 industrial enterprises over the scale of the collection of intellectualized transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of Wuhan's Bureau of Economic and Information Technology, said that this year, Wuhan launched the Action Plan on Intellectualization of Industrial Enterprises, providing free consulting and diagnosis services for industrial enterprises above the required scale and proposing solutions to promote a new round of technological transformation of high-level enterprises.
According to the plan, Wuhan openly selects a batch of professional diagnostic service organizations each year, and conducts a demand census for intellectualized transformation for all industrial enterprises above the city's scale through the opening of columns, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door reporting.
Up to now, more than 800 industrial enterprises have been collected on the intellectualization needs of information, accounting for nearly one-third of the city's industrial enterprises above the scale.

Trudo's man - made collapse. Will he be able to succeed in re-election?
This time, it was Trudo himself who had dug the "big hole" that had tripped him out of his way.
In recent days, Canadian media have repeatedly revealed a number of old photos of the incumbent prime minister, in which he disguised himself as black.
This was seen as a clear act of racial discrimination, which caused a stir in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, don't buy much.
Trudo managed to lift the stone and drop it on his own feet.
As political commentators such as Riley have pointed out, since the rise of the Anti-Black Face Movement in the United States, Mr Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have high-profilely accused opposition members or dissidents within their own party of "being guilty" of wrongdoing in this regard and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits such a mistake should be dismissed immediately".
To put it simply, this time it was Trudo himself who stumbled out of the "big hole. "
Trudo, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, was a handsome young man who had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first made his debut.
Originally a political wimp, he took over as the Liberals' leader and fought an unexpectedly good fight in the federal legislative elections of 2015, when the Liberals won a valuable seat in the lower house and a separate cabinet.
At that time, Trudeau proposed many revolutionary policies and concepts, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological protection" and "economic revival", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "corruption".
However, for five years in office, he has been "walking high" and "walking low" in almost all of these areas.
Ethnic and gender equality issues aside, the Black Face incident follows a series of rhetoric on indigenous issues that led indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to Capitol Hill on Canada's 150th anniversary.
At the end of last year and early this year, Trudeau was involved in a heated "Lang Wan Ling" campaign to end corruption.
It was revealed that his hometown's construction and engineering company, Lan Wanling, committed major irregularities and malpractices, to investigate the departments and officials in charge of pressure, the latter "high-handed.
Moreover, Trudew became angry with the disclosure official, Chaudi Wang, who was the first Canadian prosecutor-general to disclose a corruption case and worked directly on it.
Although the case itself is still suspicious, but its suspicions are difficult to wash.
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau during his five years in power was largely the result of his own "digging holes", the biggest of which were the three "tiger-headed snake-tails" "feeding on their own fruit" and "being lenient to themselves and strict with the law" .
According to the most authoritative Angus-Reid poll in Canada, respondents to Trudeau have slid from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent since 2015, while opposition has surged from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Despite similarly poor performances by other opposition parties and their leader, even a significant number of voters still willing to vote for the Liberals are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and leader of the ruling party.
On October 21st, as a new federal legislative election begins, will Trudeau be able to repeat the show he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Jiji, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened.
New Beijing News reporters from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission learned that the capital airport has been in a state of super-saturated operation, Daxing International Airport opening, will enhance the capital aviation service capacity.
Following Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city in China with two airports.It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international aviation.
Daxing airport traffic, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more favorable impact.
The capital airport handled more than 100 million passengers in 2018, ranking the highest in the country, but there is still a significant capacity shortfall compared with the fast-growing business demand, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of passengers at home and abroad for tourism, business and other purposes, and to adapt to the development trend of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally linked city, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub, with a planned annual passenger throughput of 100 million and freight and postal throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, respectively targeting different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.
From the economic point of view, it is obvious that Daxing International Airport will have a win-win effect in terms of easing Beijing's air capacity constraints, speeding up passenger and cargo throughput growth and creating an incremental cake of double-core operation of the capital airline.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to concentrate on traveling at the capital airport in the future, but it can also reduce a series of problems caused by the over-concentration of routes, such as the longer safeguarding time, the slower passenger boarding speed, the indirect increase of aircraft and passenger staying time at the airport, and the increased burden of airport operation.
According to media calculations on the time and cost of various transport routes to major international airports, for example, from the southern Wuhuan to Beijing, you can go directly to the Daxing Airport via Beijing Expressway, which is 50 minutes' drive away and about 40 yuan for fuel and 15 yuan for high-speed.
Generally speaking, the public to Daxing Airport has a variety of transport options, the cost and time is also in a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing airport is located in the transportation hub of Beijing, Tianjin and Jiangsu, so it is a little far away from Beijing, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen in the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
In addition to Beijing's new airport line directly to Daxing Airport, there are many highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding area.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via expressways such as Guangdong-Guangdong-Guangdong-Guangdong-Shenzhen, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an New Areas around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport for convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that the opening of Daxing International Airport is more than just adding a few runways and a few aircraft.It has far-reaching impact and positive significance in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development.
Therefore, for Daxing airport, we should calculate not only individual small accounts, but also the overall development of the big accounts.

Earlier this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new signs of improvement and continued to grow, said Nguyen Duan, vice-chairman of the parliamentary economic committee.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the months leading up to 2020 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2020 and 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four themes, namely, economic development in 2020 and the impact of some agreements on self-trade, some outstanding issues of Vietnam's economy in 2020, outstanding issues of Vietnam's society and culture in 2020, and forecasts and proposals on Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
The consensus among delegates was that global economic growth would slow and risks and challenges would increase in the first months of 2019.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has confirmed that despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, of which 70 per cent of the world's economies are at a standstill in growth, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many welcome successes, with a stable macroeconomic performance, effective control of inflation and an average growth rate of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019.
GDP grew 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2011, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but at a higher level compared with the same period in the 2011-2012 period.
Deng Deying, deputy director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecasting Center, said the country's economy showed a high growth momentum in 2020 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will remain basically stable, the implementation of the various self-trade agreements will contribute to the development of trade, the restructuring of the economy and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanisms, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, explore opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, we will keep inflation at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on 26 June to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that since the founding of New China 70 years ago, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world's second-largest economy, China contributes more than 30 percent to world economic growth, Liu Zhijie said, noting that China's cooperation with Siam and the provinces of the Territory has been continuously deepening, especially in the context of China's "East-East Asia Development Strategy".
He said that this year marks the opening of 61 years of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia.The two countries enjoy fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap, Mr. Siamese, highly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on their friendly cooperation.
The two sides look forward to continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthening mutual trust and mutual benefit and continuously improving people's living standards.
The Siam-Guangdong agricultural demonstration park, the Siam New International Airport project, the Siam provincial government officials' special training program, scholarships for Siam students to study in China, rural volunteer clinics, construction of urban roads and public welfare projects for the rehabilitation of cataract, and the "Bright Walk" have been the direct beneficiaries of the Siam people's friendly cooperation.
State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia Ken Man-song, Chairman of the Council of Siem Reap, Governors of the five provinces of the Territory, representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodia-China Council, volunteer teachers, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign consular missions in Siem Reap attended the reception.
Witness the " Clouds Rise " of Digital China in Yunqi Township, Xinhua News Agency
If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou held in the 2019.
From the concept of "mist in the cloud" to the practice of "up into the cloud", large data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services over the past 10 years.
At Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Plant in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new colleague with Ali Yun's artificial intelligence was nearby.
Its 24-hour non-stop, recognition speed is more than twice that of artificial, quality inspection accuracy is stable at 95%.
The camera-equipped inspector has studied more than 40,000 defective samples and, thanks to the computing power of cloud computing, can quickly convert infrared images into a binary language to categorize and place defective batteries, according to the company's director.
The company is just an epitome of today's cloud computing that has helped transform manufacturing.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatization issued the Implementation Guide for Enterprises to Go to the Cloud (2018-2020), which proposed that by 2020, the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises to go to the cloud would be greatly enhanced, and the proportion and depth of application of the cloud would be greatly enhanced.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has paved the way for a digital economy in which data is a key factor, says Wang Jian, founder of Ali Cloud.
Meanwhile, the scale of cloud computing industry in China has been expanding in the past 10 years.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (1920) released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, the total market size of cloud computing in China reached 962.8 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi conference, the "urban brain" still attracts attention for three consecutive years.
At present, the urban brain has become the hub of urban management from traffic management tools, and the relevant cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
With camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the city's brain uses its powerful computing power to implement new city management services such as "park first, pay later" "real-time perception of the number of consultations" and "tour design".
In the field of government service, cloud computing brings convenience to both sides of the supply of government service.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform through the cloud of government affairs.
By September 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million legal persons in the province, collecting data in 3066 categories of 19.8 billion.
Zhejiang's average monthly inter-departmental calls and sharing of data have reached 12 million, and every more calls on the cloud could mean fewer errands for the people.
Be careful with plastic tea bags!
A packet of plastic tea bags could release billions, if not billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's annual estimate of the amount a person consumes, but so far there is no evidence that consumption poses a threat to humans, according to a new Canadian study.
Leaving plastic tea bags in a cup of almost boiling water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles into the cup, researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reported.
This amount is significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of micro-plastics.
According to a study published earlier this year, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount.
The researchers, who reported in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, tested four different types of commercially available plastic tea bags at Montreal stores and coffee shops, opened them, cleaned them, immersed them in nearly boiling water for five minutes and analyzed them with an electron microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than the previous plastic load on other foodstuffs".
Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands that make tea bags from natural fiber still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some brands of tea bags have switched from paper to plastic, and the bags were tested by researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, defined by researchers as sizes ranging from 100 nanometers to 5mm, produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first detected plastic particles in human faecal samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team placed water fleas in contaminated water and found that the micro-plastics affected their behavior and deformed their development.
According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to date that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how the plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the bags may have released large amounts of plastic particles because they came into contact with boiling water and that even when heated above 40 degrees Celsius, edible grade plastics could break down or leak toxic substances.
Guterres says climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster can erode the fruits of development for a generation.
This has been illustrated by hurricanes that have struck Baghdad, Dominica and the Bahamas this year.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 meters or lower.
Relocation can seriously affect their social and lifestyles and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At Monday's climate action summit, small island nations are once again taking the world in the right direction as they work together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is piling up new injustices over old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Given their middle-income status, many countries are also mired in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and for international institutions to assist small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, in obtaining financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
A new special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that the oceans have suffered the "engulfed" harsh consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, extreme sea-level rise, which would have occurred only once a century, is likely to occur every year in many regions.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become inhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
Demands from industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also addressing the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples for the world to learn from.
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the current fiscal year as the financial system becomes more liquid and holiday spending demand picks up, Finance Minister Manmohan Sitaram said on Tuesday.
The statement came after a meeting with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitalaman did not specify where the remarks were aimed.
Some Indian and overseas media have previously blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for the continued slowdown in India's economy.
Taking the decline in auto sales as an example, Mr. Sitalaman denies that liquidity constraints are the main cause of the decline.
The decline in auto sales was largely due to cyclical factors, Mr. Sitalaman said.
India's economic growth is likely to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by festive spending, Mr. Sitaram said.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and lasts until the end of the year.
Shopping spending is expected to boost India's economic growth significantly.
Jiangxi Provincial Education Department recently issued a notice, banning the province's primary and secondary schools during the National Day holiday irregularities, and will organize personnel randomly to make an inquiry secretly.

Sui loyalty requirements, from six aspects to grasp the pig production of various measures to implement.
The responsibility system for mayors should be well implemented.This year, the task of raising 45 million pigs in all provinces has been decomposed into municipalities and counties and incorporated into the responsibility system.
We must implement all policies and measures and effectively solve the "last mile" problem of policy implementation.
We will do a good job in producing breeding sows capable of reproduction, earnestly implement the policy of subsidizing breeding sows capable of reproduction and encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale and select good sows from the commodity pig population in a planned way.
We should do a good job in attracting investment and take the big domestic breeding enterprises that have not entered our province as the most important ones.
We will implement the market circulation system, speed up the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs, and promote the transition from "pork-mixing" to "meat-mixing" in an all-round way.
In order to implement the modern epidemic prevention system well, all localities should equip basic-level epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel suited to the scale and tasks of farming, and establish the first line of prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui loyalty demands that all efforts be made to ensure the supply of meat market, to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage, large-scale disruption of supply, and to ensure the smooth supply of pork market during major holidays.
The meeting also deployed efforts on the prevention and control of swine plague in Africa, banning and withdrawing fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River basin and purchasing rice in the middle and late stages of the province.
Talking about the feelings of the motherland, the national soul of the Great White Rabbit, etc.

<unk>here are some sites where over-age migrant workers are estimated to account for more than half.<unk>?
Where are you looking for young workers now?
Nor do they want to use so many 'old people' on the site. There's nothing we can do."
Recently, there are many over-aged migrant workers (over retirement age) on the site, exclaimed Zou Kui, a long-time construction contractor.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities carry out rainwater drainage diversion project, there are a lot of migrant workers on campus, if you look carefully, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers.
The over-age migrant workers are not idle, but idle, with the helplessness and hardship of having to - whether it's saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems or helping their children - drive the old people who should have been idle to work.
It is not as easy as we think for over-aged migrant workers to "be old and dependent" .
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing children with schooling, helping children build buildings and buying cars, helping children start a family and raise their grandchildren in the next generation, when these migrant workers have completed their "mission of life", their moneybags have been emptied and even many debts have been incurred, most of them lacking in wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag their children and in order to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do it. "
The reluctance of many new generations of migrant workers in the "80s" and "90s" and even "00s" to work in difficult, labour-intensive secondary industries or in low-end service industries has created a structural labour shortage, and these unattractive jobs have provided opportunities for overaged migrant workers.
As a result of the lack of a skill, physical function and labor capacity declined, many over-age migrant workers are doing jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and little security.
Being able to work day after day and earning a little more can be a little more. The plight of over-aged migrant workers behind the "no idleness" should not be ignored and ignored.
In addition to their "self-saving" status, they are also inseparable from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector in solving the problems of wage arrears and wage-gathering, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour income and improving the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers.
Some scholars point out that over-aged migrant workers are unlikely to rely on farming home to solve their pension and medical problems. They must find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helplessness and firmness of the over-age migrant workers "can't be idle" will help us better understand the love and pain of the over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs and trying to find ways to get them back to the countryside to truly live their old days require the sharing of responsibilities among the public sector, the market and society in a virtuous interaction.
He said Russia would not export the system for the next five years because "it will first supply its troops and then export production".
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grehhoff, deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's space forces, said the system would be ready to be developed.
The S-500 system is developed by the "Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Corporation.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems, using the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy supersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, supersonic missiles that travel more than five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near space.
The weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemedov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in great demand around the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in operation with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to news on Sept. 15, work has been completed on the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system of the New Territories Arctic Air Defense Corps.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defense ministry says this is all part of the process of a strategic transition to more advanced defensive tools in the north.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly," the Russian Northern Fleet News Agency said.
Very importantly, the military has assessed the success of the system's use in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
The officers and men of the air defense regiment have been trained for the new system and are ready to go into combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it is still partly retained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they high-speed flying targets at high altitudes or "fish in a leaky net" approaching protected installations.
The S-400 Triumph, developed by the Diamond-Antai Air Defense Co., is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, supersonic targets and other air-attack weapons, according to public sources.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometers per second within 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the Arctic to ensure airspace security along the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an anti-aircraft battalion to strengthen the Arctic anti-aircraft system.
The Russian defence ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Tol" force would be expanded to complete brigade-level construction in the future.
Combined with the new S-400 long-range system deployed on New Isle and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir - SA short-range system deployed in the Arctic, these advanced air defense weapons are a powerful defense for Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and UAV missiles will be difficult to break through this defense.
According to the government, flagship stores will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
As a Russian grocery store operator, Russia Pindor focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
... class='class1'>Russian products are sold online in China's biggest trading platforms, including Tianmao, JD, 1688, Puinduoduo, ShouQ, and Wechat.
The Russian Export Center will work with Pindor to develop store marketing strategies and participation criteria, and screen virtual shelf-mounted products companies.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and put on shelves products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
Russian export center data shows that the total monthly visits of Chinese electricity platform up to 1 billion times.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and exceeded $1bn in 2018.
Alibaba is also opening pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
The new store will display goods from companies with sales of at least Rmb500 million or more, according to Alexei Kozyrevnikov.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher. 500 million roubles is not enough.
As we all know, Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and see our products as high-quality and environmentally friendly.
'There's a lot of competition and it's getting stronger and stronger for Chinese consumers who have a lot of purchasing power, ' Mr. Koevnikov said.
"Our goal is ambitious, " he said, "to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years. "
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian Far East enterprises products.
"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides because Russia's export centres are state-owned rather than privately owned," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor of basic trade policy at the University of Economics in Leninov, Russia.
"I don't see a lot of competitive Russian goods on the market.
He believes the project is unlikely to actually be implemented, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 Russian companies' product information has been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be bought in China and other countries, Andrew Slepnev, president of Russia's Export Centre, told the Oriental Economic Forum, according to Russia's Xinhua news agency.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely, experts from Taobao University to Russian enterprise training program, its first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also act as the organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in trade exhibitions and business projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
Large exhibitions will be held in a 1,000-square-meter hall, which will also serve as a hub for business events, agreement signing ceremonies, introductory talks and talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: "In addition to the agricultural stands, we will certainly hold business meetings, i.e., arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
This is another direction of our efforts to support enterprises and to ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.
In addition, the expo will also hold master classes, cooking competitions and the "Explore the Shanghai Station of Russian Food" project of Russian chefs cooking Russian food tasting.
Police are waiting for a full report and instructions from the Public Prosecutor's Office to take further action after the death of a life-saver was ruled non-accidental on Friday at the Mohamine Adi Coroner's Court.
According to the coroner's verdict, the police will await further instructions from the Attorney-General's Office, the National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau (NPIC) said in a statement Friday.
He stressed in the statement that the police have never terminated the investigation into the death of Mohammad, and the investigation is still in progress.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noah Chong said the police would wait for a full report of the ruling before taking action.
He responded to questions Friday morning after attending a ceremony at Xuzhou police headquarters where the deputy chief of police was handed over power.
He said the police investigated the case on the basis of reports.
He added that depending on the progress of the investigation, the police would decide whether to call again those who had previously given oral confessions.
Reporters from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscape Conservation learned that, to welcome the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, Beijing recently took Chang'an Street and its along the main axis, the overall enhancement of the landscape, to create a peaceful and festive atmosphere.
At present, 12 three-dimensional flowerbeds along Chang'an Street have been completed and displayed, the city's 20 million potted flowers decorated the capital, dressed to welcome the National Day.
Over the past few days, 12 flowerbeds in various shapes and shapes along Chang'an Street have attracted many tourists to view and take photos.

Xinhua Times Review: Firm not to move our own way
China's success in its development over the past 70 years is rooted in the fact that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct path of development with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China follows the path suitable for its own development.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty, weakness, internal worries and external troubles, generations of benevolence scholars to explore the way to save the country, up and down, forward and backward.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all been thought about and tried, and none of them have worked."
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path of the happiness of the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China with the rest of the world.
It is precisely because China is on the right path that it can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path is in line with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
The Chinese understand the truth of the northern orange, understand that the suitability of others is not necessarily for themselves, only for their own is the best.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has attracted worldwide attention.
In the tortuous course of human beings' advancement, "the end of history" has been famous for a while.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the conclusion of history, the collapse of the theory of "Chinese collapse" and the collapse of the theory of "socialist failure".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving prosperity, enriching the people and strengthening the country, and broadened the path of developing countries towards modernization.It has provided experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world who want to accelerate development and maintain their own independence and follow the path of conformity with their own national conditions.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
Rather than importing or exporting the foreign model, China will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen its exchanges with other countries in governance and governance, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance.
The boss of a Foodworks supermarket, who fired a 66-year-old woman worker by text message because he preferred to hire people of Asian descent, was fiercely criticised as “shameful”, the Fair Work Commission found.
The committee said the way Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, treated her employees was "extremely unfair" and could have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the commission, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang used to post recruitment ads on various Chinese-Australian job forums".
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Ma'am Preferred in Asia" and the other "Asian Employee Preferred".
The third post said he was "more inclined to be overseas" .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April, later citing her absence and alleged cash shortages at the cash register ranging from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
For three years she was absent from only one shift, and the "loss" amounted to several Australian dollars.
Ms. Ayton's dismissal, he said, was "in fact irrelevant to her conduct or performance".
"In my view, supported by the evidence in Mr. Wang's recruitment advertisement, the defendant's real motive for firing her was that he preferred to hire staff with Asian backgrounds.
In accordance with article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct ostensibly constitutes a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant."
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton, given her "horrific" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker at $26 a hour.
In view of possible breaches of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the committee's directors to consider whether Mr Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to what was allegedly her reason for firing, he said.
He said: "I believe that the defendant had resorted to a hopelessly unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant and that Mr. Wang "waited" the opportunity, which, in his view, would justify the termination of the employment of the applicant."
"He was wrong ... in dismissing the applicant in total disregard of any natural and fair treatment accorded to her and, as a shock, in his impolite and grossly unjust perfunctory behaviour."
Although Foodworks is a small business, "it must be frankly stated that no decent employer will fire an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case," Mr Sams said.
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

Six Denied Dealing in Fake Post-natal Paper
Six men suspected of forging and selling Chinese passports, birth certificates and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register and a businessman at the provincial level, appeared in court on Thursday, and a court judge granted charges of human trafficking and immigration trafficking to the High Court.

He stressed that he did not fear any threats of his own, but did not wish to be used by irresponsible units to degrade the Action Party and the Hezbollah Government or other Hezbollah leaders, and that the decision had been taken after careful consideration.
He also said there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of Congress, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants.
The six defendants, charged on September 12 this year, faced various charges under section 26E of the Anti-Smuggling and Anti-Smuggling Immigration Ordinance and section 466 of the Criminal Code (Forgery of Documents).

Singapore ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.

China is expected to become Australia's largest export market for beef.
China faces a severe pork shortage following the outbreak of the African pig plague and is expected to become Australia's biggest beef export market, according to an animal protein analyst at Rabobank.
Chinese consumers are switching from eating pork to other animal proteins in the wake of the outbreak, which has led authorities to destroy many livestock stocks and has reduced pig production in China by half in the past year and prices almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently importing 27 per cent of the world's pork and 24 per cent of the world's beef, said Chenjun Pan, senior animal protein analyst at the Dutch cooperative bank China.
China's beef imports from Australia rose 65 percent in the first half of this year, making it Australia's largest export market after the U.S. and Japan, Ms. Pan said.
Yesterday, Beijing said it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist party's rule.

The world's oldest hairdresser dies at 108: 96 years with a haircut
Anthony Mancinelli, the 108-year-old world's oldest barber certified by the Guinness Book of Records in New York City, never retired from daily haircuts for clients, but died on Monday of complications from jaw cancer, ending 96 years of haircuts.
After emigrating to the United States at the age of eight, he soon cleaned the floors of a barber's shop and, when he was 12, began using scissors to take care of his family's finances, CNN reported.
Mancini went to elementary school, but didn't graduate.
Though he was always healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before he died, but that wasn't retirement because he planned to come back to get his hair cut.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new hairdresser after his father died because he had had his hair cut all his life.
China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007]
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain its image, listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently in the past two years.They hope to pass the information of undervalued companies to the market through repurchase orders and auctions, thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
According to data from Oriental Wealth Choice, the funds used to buy back A-shares by listed companies amounted to $7.9bn in 2017 and soared to $510bn in 2018, and the total amount of A-share buybacks by listed companies has exceeded $100bn since 2019.
From the point of view of repurchase, the repurchase of shares seems to be the same as the increase of shareholders, but there are many differences in implementing subject, source of funds, purpose of repurchase and equity of shares.
In November 2018, the Opinion on Supporting Listed Companies to Purchase Shares was issued to rectify existing problems such as a narrow scope of stock repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and an imperfect inventory system, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Michael Rong Information Consulting Co., told Securities Daily.
In January this year, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges formally issued the Implementation Rules on Share Repurchase by Listed Companies.These policies have broadened the sources of funds for listed companies to repurchase, simplified the implementation procedures appropriately, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement stock incentives or employee share-holding schemes.
After the opinion was promulgated, the operation of stock buyback by listed companies has more applicable situations, the process of stock buyback is simpler and the enthusiasm of stock buyback is greater.
Repurchase of shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies to increase the efficiency of capital use, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, raising net asset yield and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
The repurchase of listed companies is more meaningful than the increase of their holdings, and it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that undervalued share prices are the main factor for listed companies to repurchase.The stock prices of listed companies can't reflect their future prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention.
The large-scale repurchase behavior of listed companies indicates at least the company's development confidence and capital strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for A-share buybacks has also normalized the practice, with data showing that nearly 1,000 listed companies have done so this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the market.
Ping An of China recently disclosed its progress in repurchase, saying the company has repurchased 57.59 million A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total equity, through a centralized bidding exercise.
Yi Li shares have paid $59.22 million for share buybacks, and the use of share buybacks has recently been adjusted to readjust from the original plan that the buybacks would be used exclusively as a source of stock for late-stage equity incentives to a cumulative buyback of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares would be used as a source of equity incentives, with the remaining 3.49 million to be written off to reduce registered capital.
Yili shares said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help further raise earnings per share and improve the return on investment of its shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a progress announcement, TCL Group repurchase 3.59 percent of the company's shares, a total cost of $16.5 billion.
TCL Group's board office told Securities Daily that the buybacks would be used for employee ownership plans, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies into stock.
TCL Group adheres to the established management strategy, constantly improving competitiveness, sustained and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the company's future development and the protection of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account such factors as the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to buy back its shares with its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods.
Yang Delong, chief economist at Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, said the repurchase of shares by listed companies, on the one hand, would reduce the number of shares in circulation on the market and increase earnings per share.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the outstanding shares. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through repurchase of shares, and it is also worth affirming and encouraging.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and four leading men in the engineering machinery manufacturing industry of the Hunan army Zhan Chunxin, Liang Shanggen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang have set a small goal to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster in three or five years.
To build the world's leading engineering machinery industry cluster in Changsha is, in the current fashion, to build "the strongest on the surface. "
As the capital city of inland province, Changsha shouted this boastful remark, how come?
Depends on the hegemonic leakage of strength.
The four engineering machinery Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue, each well-known, covers the sky, underground, sea, land all fields: Shanhe intelligent light aircraft, CCL's concrete delivery pump, Trinity Heavy Industries' all-ground crane, iron construction heavy industry's tunnel shield machine, its "hard strength" can be said to walk alone in the world, proud of the group.
There was a time when China had little say in the making of engineering machinery.
With the rapid development of the world, Chinese enterprises have been driven by the two-wheel drive of "introduction" and "going out" .They have taken advantage of the east wind of the "East China Straits" initiative, acquired, merged and set up factories, making a leap into the forefront of the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the leading enterprises in engineering machinery, such as Sanyi Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron and Steel Construction Heavy Industries and Shanhe Intelligent Engineering, have taken a significant lead in terms of output value, market share and sales, among other economic indicators.
Depends on the camera and the momentum control.
Xiangjun's engineering machinery is the leader of Changsha engineering machinery industry cluster and the head enterprise of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the quagmire of global industry, who can live, and live well, is the harshness of speech.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered from the cold winter, many well-known international engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha regarded the "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-imposed pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual construction, not only survived, but also strengthened their bodies.
By the stars of the moon's political and enterprises to give.
The development of advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and the government to be active.
Changsha enjoys the reputation of being the capital of engineering machinery because it has gathered the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, created clusters of related industries and reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales greatly by improving the business environment, perfecting supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises piled up.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of engineering machinery.
Both the government and enterprises, as well as the relevant producers, researchers and businessmen, should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set their goals and continue to work hard to contribute Hunan's strength to building a strong manufacturing country.

Wang said China and African countries are good brothers and partners.
In the past, in the present and in the future, China stands firmly with its African brothers.
The convening of this meeting is a concrete measure to implement the important consensus reached at the Beijing Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum in September last year between the Chinese premier and the leaders of African countries, to strengthen unity and cooperation between China and African countries in the Security Council and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Mr Wang said Africa was China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote on the Security Council always belongs to the developing countries, including African countries.
Faced with the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries in the Security Council to strengthen unity and cooperation and safeguard common interests.
The two sides should work together to resolve disputes through consultation, seek self-reliance and strengthen themselves through development and governance.
African foreign ministers thanked China for convening the meeting and congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.

At present, Africa is facing the threat of terrorism and extremism.Only by solving security problems can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordinating China's position in the Security Council and strengthening solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said today's meeting reached important consensus.
We all support the maintenance of multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, safeguarding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and opposing unilateralism and hegemony.We all agree to strengthen mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council to safeguard the common interests of China and the developing countries alike.
Qingyang, Gansu Province, China: Lake Sheep Packed to "Climb Out of Poverty".
The autumn of September paints the Loess Plateau.
Xia Weili, a 58-year-old villager at the Yimin farming cooperative in Shima township, fills the sheep pens with the last shovel of grass and watches the white lake goats chew.
It's delicious. It'll sell for a good price when it's full of fat in autumn and winter.
He says he feeds the sheep a "special nutritious meal" every day, cleans them regularly, sterilizes them and waits on them carefully.
She raised sheep for more than 20 years, until she came to work for the co-operative society, to know how extensive sheep herding.
Xia Weili is a villager in Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of scattered, poor quality of sheep, a small number of columns.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 impoverished households in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavily studied farming all day long, for he was always suffocating.
The shareholders were all poor people who trusted the sheep to the co-operative and counted on him to pay their dividends and sell them at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned how to prevent epidemic diseases, mastered scientific feeding, became the village's few breeding "good handle. "
The Yimin professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep stalls and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that standardized sheep shed inside and outside, there are doorways.
"The wool is thick and germ-prone, and the sheep in the lake cannot stay in hot and humid places. The sheep shed must be built in a three-sided trench, and a ventilator must be installed to ventilate the sheep.
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, sheep shed spray disinfection on a regular basis, three to four times in the first quarter of sheep vaccination needles.
In addition to living well, sheep have to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheat grass, alfalfa and other grass, and have a wide enough "playground" to stretch their muscles.
Cooperatives have adopted the scheme of trusteeship and subsidy to guide local farmers to bring good-bred lake goats here for unified breeding, management and marketing, so as to realize good-bred, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Nowadays, 140 poverty-stricken households with sheep shares receive more than 6,000 yuan in dividends each year, and there are four poverty-stricken people working in cooperatives.
From mountain grazing to precision feeding, from local mating to artificial insemination, from belly-seeing and belly-feeling to B-testing, meat sheep breeding in Qingyang, Gansu Province is not just a change in feeding patterns.
If market prices are weak, Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., a leading local enterprise in Gansu, will buy it at a market-protected price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk, Zou said.
Xu Jianfeng, general adviser of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said companies were helping more and more impoverished households read the Sheep Sutra by providing loan guarantee, sheep supply, order breeding, quotation purchase and unified processing and marketing services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poverty-stricken families have achieved steady increases in income through "joining" in forage breeding, breeding of good seeds, scale breeding, slaughter division and marketing.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry interlaced zone, rich in forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with a feeding capacity of over 5 million sheep, and two processing lines of 1.3 million sheep slaughtered on a slaughter scale.
French Finance Minister Says Tax Cuts Exceeding 10 Billion Next Year And Calls for Germany to Follow Up
BEIJING, Sept. 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive ailing economy, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemel said the ECB's latest monetary easing initiatives created an opportunity for more investment by governments in countries that can afford it.
The ECB cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart borrowing to keep borrowing costs down in an effort to stimulate recovery and boost inflation.
Low interest rates will not restore prosperity to Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, Lemel told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until things get worse, " he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already introduced more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, boosting the country's economic growth.
With the global economy losing momentum, Germany's export-dependent economy suffered the brunt.
Next year, the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9. 3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros in income tax credits, Lemel said.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros over a five-year period as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3% to 25%.

Study: U.S. National Health Eating Index Smallly Increases But Still Challenges
The U.S. government's healthy eating index has risen modestly from 56 to 58 in 16 years, according to a new study.
But with a full score of 100, that's not something to celebrate.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diets.
One of the study's authors, Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutritional researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans are still eating too much of the foods that can cause heart disease, diabetes and obesity, the nation's most common diseases.
The study appears in the 24th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on the findings of a government health survey of 44, 000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "in spite of significant improvements, significant dietary challenges persist".
The challenges include reducing the amount of saturated fat in snacks, hot dogs, fat cows and butter.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats rose from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended limit of 10 percent.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet has been the reduction in sugar intake from 16 to about 14 percent, but it remains too high.
Officials believe that the amount of sugar added to a daily diet should be less than 10 percent.
The researchers linked the decrease in sugar intake to a decrease in people's consumption of sweet soft drinks, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adults in the United States have seen a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains.
However, figures for 2016 show that these foods still make up less than 5 percent of the diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and reduced consumption of fruit juices, which led to low-quality carbohydrates, they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains, Zhang said.
The study was based on two-year personal health surveys that asked adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for Americans recommend adopting a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs and seed foods that provide protein.
During the study period, diabetes almost doubled to more than 7 percent of U.S. citizens and obesity increased over the years about 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Members of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Viet Nam, the Secretary of the Central Secretariat and the Minister of the Central Economic Department, Ruan Wenping, led the delegation to attend the forum.

New record for deepest shaft in China's railway tunnel
Zhang Weiming, Xu Zhou Jingbo, of Xinhua News Agency, said yesterday (September 27) that after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the construction of the No.1 shaft of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel in Jiangda (Li) Rui (Li) railway was completed.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Grand Swiss Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan Province. It runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the Jiangxi coast and is the longest single tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel, which runs through 19 faults and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 meters, is known as the "Geological Museum" of tunnel construction because it covers almost all of the geological hazards and major risks that tunnel construction may entail.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel in Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and it is an important task to increase the operating face to realize "long tunnel short strike" and ventilation in the later period of railway operation.
The successful excavation of the No.1 shaft to the bottom of the shaft marks the formal entry of the Gaoligong Hill Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction.
The shafts are all in granite formations. Because there are so many cracks in the granite formations, the water doesn't stop flowing from top to bottom. Basically, the pressure varies depending on how deep the well is.
ZhongJingZhao, chief engineer of the Dalian Railway Project Department, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, many dangerous situations such as mud inrush and collapse occurred.
The maximum inrush of water in a shaft is over 300 cubic metres per hour, at a depth of more than 700 metres, and the pressure is the same as at a depth of 700 metres.
"If we don't pump and drain water in time, we'll flood a well of 10 meters in an hour," he said.
In order to overcome the problems of longitudinal joint development, mud inrush and water-rich granite in the surrounding rock of No.1 shaft, the systemic water control measures combining exploration, injection and excavation were adopted to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No.1 shaft has formed a mechanized pipeline of excavation system, ballast release system, suspension system and winch lifting system.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of day and night construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation of 762. 59 meters depth.
The Da Rui Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the international corridor between China and Myanmar and an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "China-Pacific Economic Partnership" .
When it is completed, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours.This will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and play a promoting role in promoting China's economic and trade cooperation with South-East Asian countries and friendly exchanges between people.

The Shanghai Municipal Market Supervision Bureau and the Pudong New Area Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the 27th, launching 20 market supervision reform measures, some of which are pilots in China.
According to the introduction, the commitment to inform refers to the administrative organs in the registration of relevant licenses, in a written form to the conditions and requirements of laws and regulations to inform applicants once.

Ma Hua General Assembly Governor Nasri Wei Jiaxiang: " To the Supreme Council of FMLN discussion! "
With the Danube by-election looming, it is a matter of concern whether FMLN member Ma Hua will run for the traditional national seat.
However, after a meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of FMLN would decide whether the traditional Ma Hua seat should continue to be taken up by the Ma Hua Party or replaced by other members of the party.
Any by-election will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP), which require a meeting of the party's Supreme Council before a decision can be made, Wei told reporters after chairing a meeting of the Mahua Central Committee on Thursday afternoon.
He said the RPF Supreme Council is expected to meet in early October as the electoral commission will not meet until Monday to finalize the By-election.
Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with FMLN Chairman Gaddafi and we all agreed on the need to recapture the seat from the hopeful coalition.
"We are scheduled to hold a special FRAPH leadership meeting in early October, and the heads of the three parties will decide which member party will go forward.
Asked whether Ma Hua would insist on a traditional seat on the NPC Supreme Council, Mr Wei reiterated that as President of Ma Hua, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must be made in accordance with the NPC consensus.
"In any by-election, it is not uncommon for people to be willing to go out, for a party to go out, for a party to think they should go out."
"The most important thing is, from what organization and political alliance do we come? "
This is the test of our years of coalition, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values.
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process. "
But once the supreme council of FRAPH has made its decision, it is most precious that we should all be prepared.
In any event, Wei said, Ma Hua will be three levels, namely, the District Council, the State Council and the Central Committee, to do their utmost to prepare for the upcoming by-election.
District Councils will be headed by the Chairman of the District Council (Dan绒 Biai), Mr. S.R.S.Lin; the State Council, by the Acting Chairman of the Luzhou District Council, Mr. Lin Pei-hing; and the Central Committee, by the Acting Chairman of the Central Committee, Mr. Ma Hanshun, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Zhang Shengwen.

The United Nations awards the " Earth Warden Award " to Ant Forests
With loud applause and magnificent music, Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang stepped onto the podium to receive the trophy from the host of the United Nations "Earth Warrior Award" of the year 2019.
The ant forest project, which uses cellphone gadgets to help hundreds of millions of people take part in environmental action, won the Encouragement and Action Award at the 2009 Earth Defense Awards ceremony in New York on Tuesday.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people attending the ceremony were still thrilled.
The ant forest is an exciting innovation that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what we can do for the environment, UN Environment Programme Executive Director Ying Er Annouson told Xinhua.
It will have a tremendous impact by connecting people and their environments with technology that will allow individuals to participate in protecting the planet.
Launched in August 2016 by China's Ant Financial Services Group (CFS), the ant forest lets users "plant trees" on their mobile phones by saving "green energy" from low-carbon activities such as recording green trips in their daily lives and paying water and electricity bills online.
For each virtual tree created by the user, the ant forest and its philanthropic partners plant a real tree in a deserted area.
By August this year, 500 million ants forest users had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 120 million trees in desert areas.
Costa Rica's president, Carlos Alvarado, paid tribute to the ant forests for their contribution to " inspiring so many people to take part in green action, which is impressive," he said.
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Golden Antwear, said the award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
He said the ant forests had affected 500 million people over the past three years and the goal for the next three years was to bring a billion people around the world into low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers more income from green mountains and water.
Besides providing employment opportunities by planting trees, it hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural development projects and electricity generation platforms.
The digital-based environmental protection model created by Ant Forest has also been successfully adopted by other countries.
In June, GCash, the Philippines' largest electronic wallet, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon lifestyle.
GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental NGOs to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within the first year of the project, the spokesman said.
The "Earth Healer Award" is the highest award in the United Nations environmental protection field and is awarded annually.
The ant forest prize is the third consecutive year that a green innovation project from China has been awarded an incentive and action prize, following China's Sehanba forest site builder and China's Zhejiang Province's Qiancun Demonstration and Wancun Remediation Project.
Economic and trade frictions affect U.S. economy.
US gross domestic product growth slowed sharply in the second quarter from the previous quarter as a result of sharp declines in private sector investment and exports, the US economy's “result sheet” showed.
Analysts said trade friction and uncertainty were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
US GDP grew 2 per cent annually in the second quarter, flat on previous revised figures, but significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
Consumer growth was the main driver of U.S. growth in the second quarter, the data showed.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, rose 4.6% in the quarter, driving growth of 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter, while net exports dragged down growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Not only did private sector investment fail to sustain last year's growth, but it fell sharply as rising economic friction and uncertainty hit business confidence, said Barry Knopf, managing partner at Ensead Macroeconomic Consulting.
Under the influence of policy uncertainty, corporate capital expenditure in the United States is expected to remain in a downward trend next year, according to Knap.
While consumer growth provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, analysts say there are growing signs that trade frictions and uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the U.S. consumer outlook.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers voluntarily mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest percentage in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
Analysts generally believe the U. S. economy will continue to slow in the future.
But experts also say U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if trade and economic friction is eased.
Karen Burch, a global economist at the British Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts the U.S. economy will continue its downward trend this year and grow at a lower rate than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analysts, predicts the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 per cent this year and a further 1.6 per cent next, assuming trade frictions do not continue to escalate.
'The biggest concern for companies right now is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they create,' says Ellen Hazen, investment manager at Pardon Investments. 'If the disputes are resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the industry will perform much better.
Matt Merry, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said trade frictions remained a "top priority" and a major cause of the volatility in U.S. capital markets this year.
Parents can take 10 days off a year for children aged 0 to 3 in Ningxia
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was adopted with a high vote.
This is Ningxia's first provincial-level enactment of a comprehensive system to safeguard women's legitimate rights and interests of the local regulations, will be formally implemented on November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted by this time are revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests in Ningxia in 2007.The Regulations are divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, covering general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal liabilities and supplementary provisions.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave, which is the first in the country.
In April this year, the State Council's General Office issued the "Guidelines on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Babies Under 3 Years of Age" for couples with a related description of child-rearing.
In the process of revising the Regulations, Ningxia has innovated by encouraging employers to give husband and wife who have children to each other ten days of parental leave each year between the ages of zero and three, in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations.
At the same time, the Regulations highlighted the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the compilation of the personality rights of China's current civil code, and provides detailed provisions on the constitutional requirements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance, which specifically prohibits the frequency of sexual assault on girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, has become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Aiming at women's right to know and handle the common property of marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know the common property and the obligations of property registration institutions and related subjects, thus providing solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
In addition, to address the hot issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination.
In recent years, the Joint Public Inspection Division of the Ningxia Women's Federation and civil affairs departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing social professional forces to mediate marital and family conflicts and fight against domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.A number of laws and regulations encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.

After a marathon debate and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed a law to legalize abortion on September 26, the Internet reported.
The bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks and serious divisions within the Liberal Party have emerged since independent MP John Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Senate approved the legalization of abortion by 26 votes to 14 on Sunday night, making it the third longest-running bill in the Senate, the report said.
A final vote in the New State House of Representatives on Monday morning legalized abortion in the state.
The bill allows women to terminate pregnancy at 22 weeks and, if two doctors agree, to abort later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment Sunday night that would allow doctors to consult a multidisciplinary panel of the hospital advisory board before performing an abortion on a woman 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the Senate amendments include the need for doctors to provide adequate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
The move follows public criticism of the bill from conservatives by New York Governor Betty Glicklin, who stepped in on several occasions to gain more debate on the bill, but did not attend the final vote.
"I need to spend time running the whole new state, " she pleaded in her absence from the vote.
Liberal MP John Davis is understood to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatening to withdraw from the new state government and calling it a "government crisis".
But then Davis gave in.
"The amendments to the abortion legalization bill that were submitted to the House of Representatives on the 26th morning actually provide more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, the leader of Australia's New State National Party, Barry Laro, says he is proud to be part of a government that legalizes abortion.
What we achieved last night is historic for the new state. It legalizes abortion, it is no longer a crime, and it does not treat abortion women as criminals.

Ministry of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 86.01 billion yuan to enrich social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred some of their state-owned capital to strengthen social security funds, bringing the total transferred state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Tuesday.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the task deployment meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Administration of Finance on the same day.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full reflection of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises for the whole people and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system, and a policy measure based on the present and taking into account the long-term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for the Transfer of Some State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund, requiring selected central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun's introduction, the early stage of the transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of transfers of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions totalling some 860.1 billion yuan have been completed.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions that the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, transferring state-owned capital to 1.58 billion yuan and 1.85 billion yuan, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preliminary preparations for the transfer, laying a foundation for the implementation of the next transfer.
According to the notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds by the central and local governments will be fully launched in 2019.
The meeting convened on that day made specific arrangements for the overall deployment of the transfer.
The meeting stressed that the transfer should be carried out pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Time is tight and tasks are heavy.
Liu said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed in accordance with the requirements; press ahead with the work, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
Transfer of State Capital to Enhance Social Security Fund Starting from the point of "enhancing the money bag of social security fund", the goal is to provide strong support for the old-age insurance.
However, this is not a simple equity " physical displacement ", but a " mathematical addition ".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly promulgated the Notice Concerning the Comprehensive Expansion of the Work of Transferring Parts of State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund, specifying the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, i.e. the central and local transfer of part of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 percent of its holdings in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund.
As financial investors, social security foundations and other undertaking entities enjoy the rights of income, disposal and knowledge of state-owned shares.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that the changes in equity will not lead to changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
The author thinks that the similar transfer of state-owned enterprise's equity is not a simple change of ownership but a series of addition operations.
The first step of transferring some state capital to social security is to add the result, which can naturally reflect that state-owned enterprises are owned by all and the development results are shared by all.
After years of reform and development, the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are the continuous realization of doing better to do stronger.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided to push ahead with the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in an all-round way this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said it would work with relevant departments to fully push forward the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, and fully embody the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises among the whole people, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council.
The second step is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state funds transferred are capable of sustained profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide a source of live water for the funds.
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, one percentage point could be reduced to support the basic old-age insurance contributions of enterprises.
The third step, the addition result, is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The way to get profits from transferring the undertaker is " Dividend mainly and Run as auxiliary " .
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, do earn dividends mainly from equity.
However, as a value investor of capital market, social security fund has strong capability of capital operation.
For listed assets of state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, improve the operating level of enterprises, and have a positive and positive impact on listed companies and capital market.
At the same time, social security funds as the investment trend, stake-holding, is conducive to further strengthen its influence in the market and play a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding rational investment and value investment.

Iran Verified Developing Advanced Centrifuge Further Suspends Implementation of Iranian Nuclear Agreement
Iran has once again violated its nuclear agreement by enriching uranium with an advanced centrifuge, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating restrictions on its nuclear program in response to President Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the resumption and tightening of Iranian sanctions.
Iran, which suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and its purity below 3.67 per cent, has now moved further.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran can accumulate only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to enrich uranium, and only a small number of more sophisticated models are allowed to be used for research but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, potentially for use in nuclear bombs.
According to the IAEA report, "on 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges developed for aircraft Nos. 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium".
"They're busy at the [Natanz enrichment] facility," a diplomat said in response to the IAEA's 26th report to Member States.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
(New China 70 years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity to the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper says that as China's overall national strength and international influence grow rapidly, there are international fears that China will follow the path of "power must prevail" and so-called "China threat theory".
There are cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, and psychological imbalances brought about by the decline of power, as well as deliberate distortion to safeguard their vested interests.
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of the people of all countries to achieve national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.
China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth, and China's scientific and technological innovation will inject new kinetic energy into world economic growth.

"The McKinsey Global Research Institute's study suggests that by 2040, China's integration with the rest of the world's economies is expected to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15 to 26 percent of the world's total, and that increased cooperation between the rest of the world's economies and China will create enormous economic value.
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China, which has a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and a promising growth prospect, is of long-term benefit to the world economy.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to view China's economic development as a threat nor a challenge, and to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains and value chains and decouple it from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-directional opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share "China's dividend" .
China will unswervingly pursue the win-win strategy of opening up and achieve greater intensity and higher level of opening-up.China has the most potential consumer market in the world, China is the most attractive investment destination, and more countries will benefit from a larger-scale <unk>済ounding out<unk>?
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and for the benefit of one party.
Mutual benefit is long lasting.
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and enhancing intellectual property protection, and other countries should open up and take appropriate measures to improve their business environment,' the white paper said.
Only by moving towards each other can we create an environment for development that is open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, thus forming a mutually beneficial and win-win interest community.
The white paper points out that China offers more public goods to the international community.

Egyptian Demonstrators Shoot President Down Egyptian authorities say they are cracking down
Twitter themes and social media are vigorously advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today in a peaceful plea for President Museveni to step down.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Disapproval has virtually disappeared in Egypt since the then military chief seized power in a military coup in 2013, putting any form of protest at extreme risk.
The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo non-governmental organization, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests demanding Mr. Essy's ouster, the Guardian reported.
Thousands of people took to the streets Monday on charges of corruption over the lavish use of public money by Mr. Sessi and his family for vanity.
Egypt's Interior Ministry yesterday stood firm in its position that any attempt to destabilize the country would be resolute and not soft.
The streets around Tahrir Square, Egypt's revolutionary detonation site in 2011, were lined with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police.
Al-Jazeera television reported that security forces on the 25th detained a number of important scholars and social figures, including Cairo University political science professors, well-known columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that the continuation of absolute rule by Cecil would be disastrous, " he added on the 24th.
His immediate departure is in Egypt's interest.
Hosni, a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, was in custody before his arrest.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run for the presidency with Sessi.
Constitutional Party Chairman Saddam Hussein was also in custody.
Analysts and politicians argue that dissident sweeping reflects government instability and fragility at a time when the economic plight of the poor and middle class is intensifying.
"The seizure underscores the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and its own fears," said opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once fought for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been ruined by him, combined with widespread political repression, Cecil is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may take his place."
Under the prerequisite of a continuing deterioration in the socio-economic situation, the government's high-handedness will only increase people's anger, Mr. Knoll said.
Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor now in exile in Spain and a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, claiming to have benefited from government corruption that sparked small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Mr. Ali said his firm, Amrak General, offers lucrative contracts without going through a statutory tendering process, stressing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply repentant of his involvement.
Ali claimed that he helped set Seychelles' magnificent palaces and luxury hotels in stark contrast to the abject poverty of Egyptian life and that he had not yet been paid.
Theme tags such as "Stand Up You're Not Lonely", "Sassi You're Over", "Sassi Get Outta here" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and replies calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand his ouster.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarak has nearly seven million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday, he said in Arabic: "Sassi is doomed ... he is done, and his supporters are making a big mistake now. "

A study of athletes has shown that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, Russia's satellite network reported.
The study, led by researcher Marcel Perciglion of the Paris-Salpetrier Hospital in France, showed an inconspicuous link between mental and physical effort: both require cognitive control of activity.

INSEP raises the question of whether part of the cause of this disorder is nervous fatigue, the kind that results from over-brain work.
The study is published in the journal Current Biology.

New Regulation Asks for Opinion: Social Capital Needs Qualifications to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
Social Capital Needs Qualifications to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
Public Consultation on Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to acquire land management right
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released a notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right (Amendment Draft) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft ) to increase the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital and the acquisition of land management right by industrial and commercial enterprises.
"Opinion Draft" is now open for public comments.
To implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of "division of three powers," the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting Rights, forming the Opinion Draft.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters learned that the first publication of the draft "Opinion" several important amendments.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting defines the scope of land circulation and implements the concept of the separation of three powers.A special section is devoted to the definition of "the right to land contract and management" and "the right to land management" respectively.
In this Opinion Draft, in order to implement the concept of "three powers divided" and effectively respond to the gist of the amendment to the Rural Land Contract Law, and taking into account the differences in parties, procedures and supervision between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land management rights, the Amendment Draft defines the scope of transfer and focuses on the transfer of land management rights, including leasing, equity ownership, etc., and changes the name of the Regulation from "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" to "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights".
For the transfer and exchange of land contract management rights, administrative measures will be promulgated separately.
The opinion notes that, in the "three powers divided" background, farmers are only a certain period of land management rights.
Theoretically, even if the bankruptcy liquidation occurs, the farmers only have the risk of losing the management right for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is legally unnecessary to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing their land, priority shares, lease first, buy back and so on have been developed in practice.
Considering that the preferred stock has already been maturely discussed in the company law, it is suggested to be an advocacy provision to guard against the risk of loss of ownership.
