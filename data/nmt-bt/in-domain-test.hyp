Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate uranium enrichment, further violating the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, according to a report released on the 26th by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency.
Comprehensive foreign media reports, the IAEA report stated that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility were "accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium".
Since President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only refine uranium with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges.
Other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

Women's volleyball is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
27 against the Dutch women's volleyball team, China's two-game winning streak after being pulled back to a city, a 3-1 victory over the Netherlands, ushered in a nine-game winning streak.
The World Cup is drawing to a close, and while the title is in sight, China's women's volleyball team still has to take things lightly against Serbia.
In the first two sets against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team performed as strongly as ever, going down to the third set at 25:19, 25:16.
The Dutch women's volleyball team stepped up its attacking serve after falling behind, and China's passing attack, combined with the girls' attacking hearts, began to increase the number of errors, eventually being pulled back into the city by their opponents with 21:25 left.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the game: "The third inning, because of mistakes we gave away about 8 points. "
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team can't be underestimated, and China's women's volleyball team was prepared for difficulties before the match, although losing one set, everything was still under Lang Ping's control.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the situation, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the fire, single scored 8 points, for the team to win the great achievement.
China's women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but against the Netherlands it did sound like a wake-up call: the more important the match, the better it will be.
In the other match on Sunday, Russia and the U.S. women's volleyball team played five sets and the U.S. failed to take all three points from their opponents, allowing the Chinese team to defend its title one round ahead of time by taking all three points against Serbia.
Everything is moving in China's favour of women's volleyball.
However, the absence of all six of Serbia's main players does not mean that they will easily send the three points to China.
The fact that Serbia are virtually unbeaten medals in the current standings means they can take the field lightly against the Chinese women's volleyball team, putting their weight behind them and hitting their opponents to the hilt, while China's form may rise and fall under the pressure of winning the title.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not a "go-to-kill" lamb, after a five-game battle with the Netherlands, the Serbian two finally 3-2 to reverse the Netherlands' main line-up, thus revealing the thickness of the line-up.
Before the start of the third period, Lang Ping also said that neither team could cope well: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult and we will continue to prepare carefully as usual.
Now that the trumpet has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white heat phase" .
In terms of the squad, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above their opponents, just a last-minute crunch, but also to see whether the women's volleyball girls can play their normal level and release themselves on the court.

More than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Island Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who attended the event boarded the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a crippled person who seldom goes out because his feet are difficult to move.
He said: "Today's first cruise, close to see the magnificence of the Xiangjiang River, to feel the pulse of Changsha's development, very excited, unforgettable. "
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center in Changsha City and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provide detailed services to people with disabilities.
Specially for severely disabled people, volunteers would carry them on and off cruise ships.
Over the past seven decades, with the support of the Party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has been developing and progressing. More and more disabled people have become participants, contributors and enjoyers of socio-economic development.

However, if a hero walks beside him, it seems as ordinary as you are like me.
| | | | | | | | | | | | | |
They, in their pursuit of benevolence, lived simple, simple and persistent lives, and could easily be cheerful, without regard for fame or wealth or glory, if they immersed themselves in the business of the unintelligible and the precious.
Like Jin Yong's novels, Shaolin Temple's collection of Sutra Pavilion, although the sweeping monk, although enthusiastic Wushu, do not show off, no joy, no sorrow.
Every "sweeper" , every Naoko heart, has a share of the burden of my own country.
The nation bears not only the burden of a hero, but also the palm of a billion people.
Once upon a time, a female high school student's words were wildly circled by netizens. "When a hero passes by, someone will always sit by the roadside and clap ...
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
He who applauds by the roadside also transmits heat and light, and he himself is a luminous body.
Ordinary as you are me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are moments, there is a cumulative, but also a heroic look.
Zou Bihua, a distinguished judge in Shanghai who has undertaken the task of judicial reform, had his master master tell his story at the annual meeting and sent and received numerous newspaper letters a year.
It's a little love between heroes, a hero applauding another hero.
Sweeping monks have Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Nanren East has "sky-eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit ... whether to be a hero or not depends not only on one's own efforts, but also on a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, the eye of the sky in China seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Tzu-xin had not yet begun to write The Three Dimensions.
The cow's "eye" at that time was the Arecibo, a single-caliber radio telescope in the valley of the American island of Puerto Rico, 350 metres in diameter, considered the "insurmountable" of the world.
At that time, Chinese radio telescopes were less than a tenth of the diameter.
Nan Rendong, enjoying world - class research and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: build a new generation of radio telescopes in China, and receive more messages from outer space!
China is dying for fun, investing a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nanrendong, and the "Sky-Eye" project opened widely.
It took 12 years to select the site and 9 years to complete the project.
The 500 - meter - caliber "eyes of the sky" opened and China achieved " the world's unique big scientific project " without precedent.
Therefore, the eye of the sky is great, the South Rendong people are great, there is room is great, standing on the far side of the republic is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, the South Rendong people have the opportunity to become the soul of the people's liver and courage.
There are young talents, gray-haired heroes walk through, there are people in the roadside gently applause, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.

Chirac dies, political legacy lives on
Former French President Jacques Chirac passed away on Sunday at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a state of unprecedented change in a century, the French politician's political legacy still deserves some credit.
Chirac was president of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He not only inherited Charles de Gaulle's independent spirit of diplomacy, but also firmly supported European integration, is the representative of the pursuit of the European dream.
At the same time, he also strongly advocated the world multipolarity and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of a politician.
For this reason, the French media described him as "France's outstanding representative on the world stage".
One of Chirac's gleeful political determinations was to oppose the American-dominated war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to counter American pressure and lead the way in the war.
A year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Later facts proved Chirac's warning to be correct.
At a time when European integration is hesitating and American unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly enlightening.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel more familiar and gracious.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the Golden Decade of Sino-French Relations and, after being first elected French president in 1995, promoted the rapid development of China-France relations through the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac's administration, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy and railway transport.
The Chinese-French Cultural Year initiated by Chirac created a completely new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that Chirac can recite some of Li Bai and Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the history of Chinese bronzes.
"It's not true that you've been to Egypt without looking at the pyramids, or China without looking at the terra-cotta warriors" -- a golden phrase derived from Chirac.
"The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political standing in the world," Chirac told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
But I have a lot of confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it establish the concepts and values to achieve harmonious development and to take its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.
I also believe that China's renaissance will bring new vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Greeks are gone, but Chirac's political legacy and inspiration for the world will live on.

HKSAR Legislative Council Members' Union opposes US-Hong Kong-related bill
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) partially constituted factions issued a joint statement yesterday expressing strong opposition to the passage of the 2019 Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy by the U.S. Senate and Senate Foreign Committees.
The statement, issued by the 40-member Association of Established Members, said Hong Kong's rights were currently enshrined in the Basic Law, including maintaining the status of a free-trade port and a separate customs area, trading, communications, tourism, culture and sports, and entering into and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China" with different countries and regions around the world.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Since then, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in many related fields of cooperation.
The statement said the move by the U.S. Senate and Senate committees to pass the bills was unnecessary and was intended only to respond to calls from their proxies in Hong Kong as a means of grossly interfering in the internal affairs of the country and gaining political leverage for their proxies in Hong Kong.
Establishment lawmakers deeply regretted the move and strongly opposed it.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
By passing this bill, the United States will not only attack Hong Kong and its own interests, but will also aggravate China-U.S. relations at no expense to others.
The statement said that Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" principle, continue to enjoy the rights under the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations.
Whether it is past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade.
France's two houses of parliament are due to discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently claimed that France could not "admit everyone" , but also tried to "properly admit" .
According to the report, Mr. Makron is trying to find a middle ground on immigration to ease the shock of the coming debate.
In an interview during the general debate at the U.S. General Assembly in New York recently, Mr. Makron said he wanted a real two-pronged approach to immigration policy that strikes a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"France cannot admit everyone if it wishes to admit [immigrants] properly," Mr. Makron said.
He cited four priorities of his immigration policy: granting asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; and more efficiently resettling those who entered France illegally and were unfit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Aid (AME) system has been the subject of much debate.
Mr Makron said he wanted to be able to "evaluate" the system, but did not remove it, but put a limit on it.
In the wake of his remarks, far-right National League leader Marine Le Pen tweeted that Duterte's stance was "empty talk" .
Senate President Raheel, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "softening" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Mr.
Law, a member of the leftist Socialist Party, argued that France should be "more receptive and better" on immigration and criticized the issue as a "manifestation".
A year after the new Asylum and Immigration Act, it has divided opinion within the ruling party but failed to appease right-wing opposition parties, the report said.
The subject of immigration policy will again be the focus of far-right attacks in the next 2022 elections, and Mr Makron needs to do something about it, but risks angering the left within the ruling party.
The lower house of France's National Assembly is set to debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are in the midst of a rush of buybacks, with many listed companies offering genuine gold and silver to buy back shares.
According to financial data service Eastern Wealth, the total amount of repurchases of listed A-shares in 2019 exceeds 100 billion yuan (yuan, the same amount below), well ahead of the previous year's figures and a record high of A-share repurchases.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Rong Information Consulting Co., said the lower overall valuation of the A-share market this year and the repurchase of shares at a relatively low price would help the listed companies improve the efficiency of the use of funds, as well as reflect the willingness of the listed companies to actively manage market capitalization and abundant cash flow, which would help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of share repurchase system has also promoted the listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
Earlier this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed implementation rules for share repurchase by listed companies, providing detailed guidelines and guidelines for share repurchase by listed companies.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the buyback plan so far this year are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics industries.
In addition, six listed companies have repurchased more than one billion yuan this year in terms of buyback payments.
Topping the list was Erie shares, which were repurchased for more than $5 billion.
What impact will listed companies have on the market for share buybacks?
Zhao Xijun, vice president of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, told reporters on the one hand that the repurchase indicates that the listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial position, the ability to maintain price stability and give investors confidence, and that the listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, market and investors.
The former is based on the good performance of the company, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the core element.
Repurchase of shares of listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies.
Meanwhile, according to the Oriental Securities Review, the estimated share repurchase volume of listed companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average transaction price of repurchased shares, is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan in incremental funds for the market.
Within nearly two months, the restoration of Tian Hougong, a large-scale mural by Tianjin Tianjin's key national cultural and cultural security institution, will be reopened during this year's National Day after the completion of restoration work on the 26th.
"The Divine Monument of Heaven Queen" is a large traditional mural that fully reflects the life of Ma Zuzu.
Approved by relevant state departments, it was drawn from 1991 to 1994 by Cai Changkui, the former director of Tianjin Folk Museum (Tianhai Palace).
The mural, painted on the north and south walls of the Tianhu Palace, is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high. It is divided into two parts, using more than 30 stories, such as the birth of the Queen, the crossing of the sea, the rise of feathers and so on.
In recent years, Tianjin has had wet summers and dry winters, causing the murals to crack, accounting for 60 percent of the total area, Cai said.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mazu, Tianjin Nankai District ancient culture street management committee and Tianhu Palace started the restoration project of Tianhu Palace and the murals inside the palace.
The restoration project, led by Choi Changkui, invited four famous Chinese painters to participate.
In accordance with the principle of 'repair as old as ever', the original murals were also partially adjusted and the original imperfections were replenished.
In repairing, we have also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen and ink, etc.
The restoration has preserved the original mural's appearance, spirituality, spirit and artistic style.
Built in 1326, the Tianhu Palace, formerly known as the Imperial Palace, has undergone numerous renovations, Tianjin City is the oldest complex, and one of the earliest surviving times in China's Mazu Temple.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport launching ceremony was solemnly held.
The modeling of Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal, which means "Phoenix spreads its wings, " has been hailed as the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
Beijing Capital International Airport is now overloaded, carrying more than 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta Airport.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers and 20 percent of international flights by 2022, and 72 million passengers and 30 percent of international flights by 2025.
As the New Country Gate, how cool is it?

Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two levels of arrival and two departures - F1-F4 is international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure and international departure.
A double deck bridge outside the terminal connecting the high-speed terminal with the airport, corresponding to the terminal F3, F4 - International Departure Upper Floor, both floors of the domestic departure.
Beijing Daxing International Airport inaugurated the era of Beijing's "double airport" .
Located as a major international aviation hub, a new power source for national development and a comprehensive transportation hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region supporting the construction of the Xiong'an New Area, the new airport has so far attracted 66 airlines interested in entering Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong-Macau-Taiwan regions and foreign airlines.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This forms a coordinated development, moderate competition and international first-class competitiveness of Beijing Capital International Airport, which not only relieves the operational pressure of capital airport capacity saturation, but also better meets the urgent need of the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and surrounding areas, and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport fully considers the geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operating environment.For the first time, the airport runway adopted an all-directional layout, adopted the world's largest automated air-tube system, and established China's largest terminal control area to maximize aviation operational efficiency.
For the first time, China's airports of this size have adopted a home-made baggage automatic processing and information management system, adopting an innovative baggage transfer model to improve baggage handling efficiency.

Wang Boxiang, Secretary, Yuan Shouguang County, Shandong Province--Chinese Xinhua
Wang Boxiang, a native of Shouguang, Shandong Province, was born in February 1943 and took part in the work in 1967.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was secretary of the Shandong Shouguang County Committee, then the poor county of Weifang.
During his five years in office, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing the Shoubei salt flats; and laying the foundation for an industrial rollover, allowing Shouguang people to bulge their pockets and straighten their backs.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but also have a lesson in growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers planted vegetables but could not sell them, rotting in the fields.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasping vegetables is to do a good job in circulation.
Shouguang pioneered the establishment of the wholesale vegetable market, opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party cadres should take the lead and mess up. All losses should be borne by the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, set up 17 winter-warming vegetable huts, in which 17 "double-thousand-yuan households" sprouted up.
Afterwards, the county set up a promotion team, and under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi toured the towns and villages to guide; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted, then vegetable sheds like prairie prairie to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million mu of land in northern Shoushou except salt flats, that is shallow beaches.
The local people live very hard.
Shou Nan has vegetable big shed, how does Shoubei do?
Wang Boxiang organized a meeting of hundreds of thousands of people to camp on the deserted alkali beach for forty or fifty days.
Leading cadres in Wang Boxiang and the county lived and ate on the construction site, carrying loads on carts, carrying loads like migrant workers, sleeping rough on wind and food, when the people saw them, they all held out their thumbs and admired them in their hearts.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county council.
During the meeting, the next issued a "Weifang twelve counties of urban industrial economic data comparison table" , at first glance, the value of total industrial output, Shouguang is good, ranked fourth.
But if the raw salt were removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output would be worth only $119 million, the third-lowest.
Wang Boxiang, with a delegation of more than 70 people, ran to the field for a change of mind.
Within a year of returning, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we have organized "Take Sutra Group" to collect Sutra in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang shortage of enterprises, even less entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the panel: In the county's open selection of factory managers, 40 "career-minded people" stand out, pushed onto the industrial front line.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the 100 best counties in the country, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang deputy mayor.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable huts, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4,485 enterprises, more than 100,000 yuan households, and a contingent of cadres recognized by the people, who still affectionately call him "our auspicious secretary".
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presides over the Council of Foreign Ministers of China and the African member states of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 26.
Current African Security Council member Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister Bernard Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Bernard Oryono, South African Foreign Minister Peter Pandol and the member-in-waiting Niger Foreign Minister Mikhail Kara and Tunisian Foreign Minister Sheikh Jainavi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, by uniting forces.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.As a direct result, the basic norms of international relations are challenged, and the role of the United Nations is undermined, to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to join hands and shoulder to shoulder so that unity can be strengthened.
In the Security Council, the three African nations speak with one voice, focusing not only on three votes, but on the entire continent.
Together, China and Africa will not only have 4 votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2001, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council.
Second, settle disputes through negotiation.
China has been advocating political settlement of hot-button issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly the hot spots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
We should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play a good role in mediation and good offices of the United Nations.
Third, self-improvement by self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing hot-button issues in Africa, the Security Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capacity-building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, governance by development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We should put economic and social development first and support each other on the road of development chosen by them.
China is ready to work closely with the African Union Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and African countries' development strategies to help African countries strengthen their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in African development.
The outbreak of Ebola in the Congo has occurred again.China has and will continue to do its utmost to provide human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate with African countries and mobilize more assistance from the United Nations and WHO to play a good role in the UN Stabilization Mission in the Congo (King).

Wuhan Promotes Intellectual Renovation of Industrial Enterprises
Since this year, the city has accelerated its intellectualized industrial transformation and implemented a transitional subsidy of up to 20 million yuan, reporters said at a series of press conferences organized by the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office.
So far, more than 800 industrial enterprises have collected more than the size of the intelligent transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of Wuhan's Bureau of Economics and Information Technology, said that this year, Wuhan launched an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, to provide free consulting and diagnostic services for industrial enterprises of more than the size required, and to propose solutions to fully promote a new round of technological transformation of high-level enterprises.
According to the plan, Wuhan city openly selects a batch of professional diagnostic service organizations each year, through the opening of columns, questionnaire surveys, door-to-door reporting and other forms, for all industrial enterprises above the size of the city to carry out intelligent restructuring needs census.
So far, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have collected intellectualized transformation needs information, accounting for more than one-third of the city's industrial enterprises.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to join enterprises in batches to carry out "one-to-one" on-site evaluation and program demonstration.
Zhang said the city is currently organizing 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total investment of 29.76 billion yuan.The first 5G intelligent production line in Hongxin Communications China, the first nationally advanced intelligent mobile phone production line in Motorola, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, the first batch of satellite production lines in the country by aerospace engineers, the world-leading veterinary drug intelligent production line in Huisheng, and a number of leading smart home Internet of industries, such as the leading smart home and intelligent product line in Europe, began construction.

Trudeau's " collapse of man ". Can he succeed in re - election?
It was Trudeau himself who stumped out of the "pit" that led him a long way.
Recently, Canadian media have revealed a number of photographs of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posing as a black man.
It was seen as an overt act of racial discrimination that caused uproar in Canada.
Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public after the incident.
Canadians, however, don't pay much.
Trudeau lifted a stone and struck himself in the foot.
As political commentators such as Riley have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the federal Liberals have high-profilely accused the opposition or the party's dissidents of "big losses" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake deserves immediate dismissal".
Quite simply, it was Trudeau himself who stumped out of the big hole that led him.
Trudeau, the handsome young son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first set out.
Originally a "politician", he took over as head of the federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly good fight in the 2015 federal legislative elections in Canada - the federal Liberal Party gained valuable single-team cabinet positions over halfway through the federal lower house.
At that time, Trudeau proposed many dotage-inducing policies and ideas, such as "Ethnic and Gender Equality" "Environmental Protection" "Economic Revitalization", stressing the elimination of corruption and "unjust winds".
Nevertheless, for five years in office, he has been reckless in almost all of the above-mentioned respects and "walk high and low".
Take "Ethnic and Gender Equality," the "blackface" incident aside, after a series of rhetoric on aboriginal issues led indigenous groups and leaders to move their protest tents to the gates of the Capitol on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the fight against corruption, Mr Trudeau became embroiled in the uproar at the start of last year.
It was exposed as a major malpractice case against his hometown construction engineering company, Lan Wanling, and pressured the departments and officials in charge of the prosecution to “exalt the noble hand”.
Moreover, Mr. Trudeau's anger at the officials who disclosed the abuses after the row erupted was that of Mr. Wang, then Canada's attorney general, who was the first to disclose the abuses.
Although the case itself remains suspicious, its suspicion is difficult to wash.
Many observers have pointed out that Trudeau's five years in power were largely the result of digging pits, and that the biggest pits were those of the tiger-headed snake-tailed snake-eat-its own expense and the law-abiding, stricter-than-law man.
Since 2015, support for Mr. Trudeau has slipped from more than 60 percent to more than 30 percent, while opposition has soared from less than 30 percent to more than 60 percent, according to the most authoritative Angus-Reid poll in Canada.
While other opposition parties and their heads have performed equally poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who would still vote for the federal Liberals are now unimpressed with the prime minister and the head of the ruling party.
On October 21, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are due to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat the drama he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened to traffic.
The Beijing News has learned from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is in an oversaturated state, and that the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's aviation service capacity.
After Shanghai, Beijing becomes the second city with two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs and Pudong Airport is dominated by international shipping aviation.
Daxing airport traffic, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more of a positive impact.
Capital Airport ranks first in the country in terms of passenger throughput of more than 100 million in 2018, but there is still a significant gap in capacity compared with fast-growing business demand, particularly for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of passengers at home and abroad for tourism and business trips, and to meet the development trends of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected cities, Daxing International Airport has been designated as a major international hub airport.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, targeting different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.
From the economic point of view, Daxing International Airport's traffic will obviously have a win-win effect, easing the tension of Beijing's air capacity, speeding up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake for the capital's aviation dual-core operations.
From a user's point of view, the future of Daxing International Airport does not have to be focused on the capital airport, nor can it reduce the number of problems caused by the concentration of routes, such as longer security periods, slower passenger boarding speed, indirectly increasing aircraft and passengers in airports, increasing the burden of airport operations, and reducing the traffic load through the capital airport, in fact, improve the passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of multiple transportation routes to large international airports, such as starting from the southern five rings and driving directly from Beijing to Daxing Airport Expressway, a 50-minute drive will take you around 40 yuan for gas and 15 yuan for a high-speed round trip. Instead, choose the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line, which is limited to 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers in distance, with fares of 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan.
In general, there are a variety of transport options for people to get to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development: Daxing airport is located in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little far away from the Beijing area, but it strengthens radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the transportation planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport is well equipped with transportation facilities, in addition to the Beijing District direct to Daxing Airport's new airport line, there are a number of highway connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via expressways such as Guangfo and Guangshen, residents of Langfang around Beijing and Xiong'an New Area will also benefit from Daxing Airport and get convenient and efficient aviation services.
From this, we can see that the navigation of Daxing International Airport has not only increased several runways and several aircraft, but also has far-reaching and positive significance in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration.
Therefore, for the passage of Daxing airport, we should not only calculate the individual's small account economically, but also the overall development of the big account.

Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum held in Chengtianshunhua Province
Earlier this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new signs and continued to grow, said Nguyen Dejian, deputy head of the country's parliamentary economics committee.
The forum focused on the outstanding economic and social issues in the months leading up to 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on the four themes of economic development in 2019 and the impact of some of the free trade agreements, prominent issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, prominent issues in Vietnam's social and cultural development in 2019 and projections and proposals for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that global growth will slow in the first few months of 2019, with increased risks and challenges.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
Despite global economic uncertainty, with 70 per cent of the world's economies in a stagnant state of growth, the International Monetary Fund determined that Vietnam's economy had achieved many encouraging achievements, with macroeconomic stability running smoothly and inflation effectively under control, and the consumer price index expanding by an average of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2009, the slowest pace in nearly three years.
Growth in GDP for the first half of last year was 6.76 per cent, down from 7.05 per cent a year earlier, but still relatively high compared with the same period in 2011-2016.
Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said the Vietnamese economy is showing high growth momentum in 2019-2020 against the backdrop of global economic turmoil.
By 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic stability is expected to continue, and the implementation of the free trade agreements will boost trade development, further strengthen economic restructuring and business environment improvement.
It was therefore necessary to strengthen monitoring and early warning mechanisms, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, explore opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, inflation will be kept at a reasonable level to promote the development of subsidiary industries and support the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the consular office of the Chinese Embassy in Siem Reap, celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China by holding a reception in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
Since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more to improving global economic governance and promoting common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and well-being, Liu said.
As the world's second-largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth exceeds 30 percent, Liu said.In particular, China's 鈥淐hina initiative鈥?has led to deepening cooperation between local provinces and cities, as well as Siem Reap and the neighboring provinces.
He said this year marks 61 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Cambodia, the two countries have brotherly friendship, and China-Cambodia mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force for economic and social development there.
The governor of Siem Reap Province, D'Isaihar, highly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on the achievements of friendly cooperation.
The two sides look forward to continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and continuously improve people's living standards.
The friendship between Siem Reap Province and China's 28 provinces and municipalities has been remarkable, he said.The Angkor Smile and the Angkor Dynasty, the large-scale cultural performance projects, the Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Garden, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, special training courses for Siam provincial officials, scholarships for Siam students to study in China, countryside clinics, rehabilitation of urban roads, cataracts and rehabilitation of public welfare projects, have been fruitful, and the Siam people have become direct beneficiaries of the friendly cooperation between Cambodia and China.
The reception was attended by Cambodian Secretary of State for the Ministry of Defense Ken Vinsong, Chairman of the Council of Siem Reap Province, Weng Heng, Governor of the Territory's 5 provinces, Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Siam Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign consular corps in Siem Reap.
Witness the Ten - Year Cloud Rise in China in Yunqi Town - Xinhua News Agency
If 2009's local web forum is the starting point, the 2009 Cloud Habitat Conference in Hangzhou, 25-27, has been a full decade.
From the concept of "in the cloud" to the practice of "in the cloud" , big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that underpin China's economic development, social management and public services over a decade.
At the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, QC inspectors recently beside a number of new "colleagues" equipped with Aliyun artificial intelligence.
Its 24-hour continuous, the identification speed is more than twice that of manual, the accuracy rate of quality inspection is stable at 95 percent.
The camera-equipped inspector, who has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, has been able to quickly convert infrared images into binary languages to sort and place faulty batteries using cloud computing power behind them, company officials said.
The company is a microcosm of today's cloud computing-assisted manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MOI) has issued the Guidelines for Promoting Enterprises on Cloud Implementation (2016-2020) in 2018, and proposed that by 2020, the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on cloud should be raised markedly, and the proportion of clouds on clouds and the depth of application should be increased markedly.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy of key elements, said Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun.
At the same time, China's cloud computing industry has been expanding over the past decade.
The overall market for cloud computing in China will reach 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, up 39.2 percent from 2017, according to the China Institute of Information and Communications' White Paper on Cloud Computing Development, released in July.
In addition to becoming the key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Cloud Habitat conference, three consecutive years of appearance of the "urban brain" still attracts attention.
At present, the urban brain has become the center of urban management from transportation management, and its cooperative application has expanded to 23 cities around the world, Ali said.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the urban brain is able to realize new urban management services such as "park first, pay later" "real-time perception of attendance" and "travel route design".
In the field of government services, cloud computing has facilitated the supply of government services at both ends of the spectrum.
At present, Zhejiang through the government affairs cloud, has built the province's unified public data platform.
As of Sept. 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million corporate units in the province.
With an average of 12 million monthly calls and shares between government departments in Zhejiang Province, each additional call flow on the Cloud may mean less errand-running for the masses.
Careful use of plastic tea bags to make tea!
A new Canadian study found that a pack of plastic tea bags could release billions, if not billions, of plastic particles, significantly more than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but so far there is no evidence that consumption poses a threat to humans, Central News Agency reported.
Researchers at Magill University in Canada reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and coffee shops, opened them, washed them for five minutes and immersed them in nearly boiling water, then analyzed them with an electronic microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that the single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several steps above the plastic load of other previous foods".
Most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some branded tea bags have switched from paper to plastic, which researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, which researchers define as between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size, mainly produced by the breakdown of plastic waste.
The researchers found traces of plastic particles in the world's air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human feces samples from several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of teabags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team put water fleas in contaminated water and found that microplastics influenced their behavior and caused them to develop developmental deformities.
According to the World Health Organisation, there is so far no evidence that consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how the plastics spread to the environment and the impact on humans.
The researchers speculate that the release of large quantities of plastic particles may be due to the contact of the bags with boiling water, which can break down or leach toxic substances even when heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Mr Guterres said climate emergencies were the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster can eat away at the fruits of a generation's development.
This is illustrated by the cyclones that have struck Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas since the beginning of the year.
About a quarter of people in SIDS live at an altitude of 5 meters or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their social and lifestyles and even raise questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island nations worked together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030, once again leading the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is stacking new injustices onto old injustices.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to take major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, obtain financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the lifeline of the Earth - the oceans.
The latest special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released this week, confirms that the oceans have suffered the harsh consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may experience extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once a century.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken a heavy toll.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the past 150 years, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also struggling to cope with the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved everywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples to draw upon around the world."
He emphasized that small island developing States were a particular example of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's finance minister said Tuesday the financial system is now liquid and growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumer demand.
Mr Sitaraman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitaraman did not specify the point of the remarks.
Some Indian and overseas media have blamed the continuing slowdown on tight liquidity at non-bank financial institutions.
Citaraman, citing the fall in auto sales as an example, denied that tight liquidity was the main cause of the decline.
Sitaraman points out that the decline in auto sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
Mr. Sitaraman expects India's economic growth to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and runs until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's growth.

Support pig production to safeguard market supply
Sui Loyalty Requires Implementation of All Measures in Six Aspects
The province promotes pig production guarantee market supply TV teleconference convened today, on the implementation of the central and provincial governments to support pig production guarantee market supply policies and measures to mobilize re-deployment.
Sui loyalty requirements, from six aspects of good pig production measures to implement.
The mayor responsible for the implementation of the "Food Basket" system, this year the province's clear 45 million pigs out of the stalls of the task has been broken down to the city and state, into accountability assessment.
We will implement all policies and measures to effectively solve the problem of implementing the "last kilometer" policy.
We will implement the policy of subsidizing the production of sows that can reproduce well, encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of pigs, and select good sows from the commercial pig population in a planned way.
We will take the domestic famous large-scale aquaculture enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority in attracting investment.
We will implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for raw pigs, and promote the transition from "pig regulation" to "meat regulation".
To implement the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grass-roots quarantine personnel commensurate with the scale and tasks of breeding, so as to establish the first line of prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui Loyalty calls for the full protection of the meat market, ensuring that there will be no large-scale shortages and widespread supply disruptions, and the supply of pork on major holidays will be stable.
The meeting also deployed the work of preventing and controlling the swine plague in Africa, preventing the catching and returning of important waters in the Yangtze River basin and purchasing rice in the province.
Talking about the Motherland and the National Soul The White Rabbit and other old Shanghai symbols represent Party lessons for college students

Abe's video message wishes New China its 70th anniversary
On the 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary by video.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, everyone.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I wish, on behalf of the Government and people of Japan, to extend warm congratulations.
At the G20 Osaka Summit held in June, Japan and China cooperated to make the summit a success, and adopted the Declaration on the Osaka Summit of the G20 Leaders, proclaiming to the world the firm will of the G20.

"Some overage migrant workers on some sites are estimated to make up more than half of the workforce.
Where can I find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many'old people'on the site.
Zou Kui, a longtime construction contractor, lamented the recent phenomenon of overage migrant workers on the site (beyond retirement age).
Recently, the author's colleges and universities undertook rain pollution diversion projects. Many migrant workers appeared on campus. If you take a closer look, you will find that there are many overage migrant workers on campus.
Overage migrant workers are not unemployed, but are driven by the helplessness and hardship of not being idle, having to do so - whether saving money to solve their old age and medical problems, or helping their children - to continue to work hard.
The overaged migrant workers are not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, reading books, building houses for children, buying cars, starting families and raising grandchildren on alternate generations, when these migrant workers have fulfilled their "life tasks", their pockets have been hollowed out and even a lot of debts remain, most of them lacking in wealth accumulation.
In order not to put off their children and to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on working until they can't.
The reluctance of many new generation migrant workers after "80" or even "00" to engage in hard-pressed, high-intensity secondary industries or low-end service industries has resulted in a structural "employment shortage", unattractive jobs that provide opportunities for overage migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills and the decline of physical function and ability to work, many overage migrant workers are doing jobs with high intensity, low income, high risk and little security.
The plight of the overaged migrant workers behind "no idleness" cannot be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of unpaid wages and salaries, to improve labor protection, reduce security risks, increase labor income and improve the survival of overage migrant workers, besides their "self-saving" status, cannot be separated from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their old-age pension and medical problems, they must support their families through other means.
Understanding the helplessness and strongness of over-age migrant workers "cannot be idle" helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the back of the overaged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and finding ways to make them truly "old-fashioned" in the countryside require a combination of efforts from the public sector, the market and society to share the responsibility in a benign interaction.
Mr. Chmeezov said Russia would not export such a system for the next five years because it would "supply its own troops first and export production thereafter".
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment have always ensured their national defence requirements before handling export orders.
Earlier, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, General Yuri Glihov, said the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system is developed by "Diamond-Aetna" Airspace Defense Compaqen.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that use the working principle used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles that can intercept missiles with a range of up to 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near-space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, particularly the S-400 systems, which are important from a national defense perspective.
Sergei Chmeezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system enlists the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to September 15, the New Territories Arctic Air Defense Corps has completed the conversion of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defence ministry says this is all part of a transition plan to a more advanced defence tool in the northern strategic direction.
"As the transition to a new S-400 air defence system proceeds, the controlled airspace in the Arctic region increases significantly," the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service said.
Importantly, the military estimates that the system has been used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air defense regiment officers and men trained for the new system and made preparations to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, part of it remains in place.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying all kinds of air targets, be they high-speed targets in the outer altitudes or "leaky fish" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the Diamond-Aetna Airspace Defense Concheon, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air-attack weapons.
The weapon can strike aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometers per second at a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it would deploy additional air defenses in the Arctic to ensure airspace security along the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the Arctic's air defence system.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Tor" force would be expanded to a full brigade-level system in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed to Newlands and the Kola Peninsula and the Armor (Pantsir)-SA short-range systems deployed in the Arctic, these advanced air defense weapons effectively defend Russia's polar skies.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
The Russian company, which operates Russian stores, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russia has online stores on Tmall, Jingdong ( JD ), 1688, Sindu assiduous, ShouQ and WeChat, China's largest trading platforms, and has its own online platforms, Spin assidu.com and Russian merchandise retail chains.
Russia's export center will work with Russia to formulate marketing strategies and participate in standards and screen virtual shelf products enterprises.
Stores are scheduled to open by the end of this year and hit shelves with products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits of Chinese electricity platforms are as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have grown steadily since 2014, topping $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
The new stores will display merchandise from businesses with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more, Aleksey Kogevnikov said.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles worth of sales are negligible.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our products as high-quality and green environmentally friendly.
Competition among Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying, Mr. Kogevnikov said.
He said: "We have an ambitious goal of launching 500 businesses through this store within three years. "
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian companies in the Far East region products.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the basic faculty of trade policy at Russia's Plehanov University of Economics, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides because the Russian export centres are state-owned rather than private institutions.
"I don't see a lot of very competitive Russian goods in the market. "
He believes the project is likely not to be implemented in earnest, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said product information for more than 170 Russian companies had been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale platform, and could be bought in China or other countries, RIA Novosti reported.
There is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July.
Russia's export center will also act as an organizer for Russian companies to participate in trade shows and commercial projects at the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-metre exhibition hall, which will also serve as a hub for business project events, signing ceremony, presentations and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural companies.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: "In addition to the agricultural exhibition stands, we are bound to hold business meetings, that is, to arrange for direct linkages between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction in our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them."
The expo will also host masterclasses, cooking contests and a Russian-American food tasting session for Russian celebrity chefs under the program "Shanghai Station for Exploring Russian Food".
Police await a full report and instructions from the Attorney General's Office before taking their next steps after a verdict of non-accidental death at the Morha Morimou Adi Coroner's Court on Friday.
In a statement issued Friday by the National Police Criminal Investigation Service, Governor Richard Hoozl, said police would await further instructions from the Attorney General's Office in light of the coroner's ruling.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never stopped investigating Moha's death and that the investigation was still ongoing.
On the other hand, Xuezhou Chief Superintendent Noah Occupan said police would wait for a full report of the verdict before taking action.
He responded Friday morning to an inquiry after attending a ceremony at the state police headquarters to hand over the duties of the deputy chief constable.
He said police investigated the case on the basis of reports.
He added that the police would also defer to the progress of the investigation and decide whether to call people who had been previously interviewed for statements.
According to the Beijing Landscape Bureau, to welcome the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Beijing has recently adopted Chang'an Street and its axis to enhance the landscape and create a peaceful and festive atmosphere.
At present, all 12 three-dimensional flower beds along Chang'an Street have been completed, the city's 20 million potted flowers to dress up the capital, dress up to welcome the National Day.
Over the past few days, 12 magnificent and varied three-dimensional flowerbed landscapes along Cheung On Street have attracted many visitors and photographers.
From the beginning of the "Magnificent 70 Years" in the northwestern corner of Jianguomen to the end of the "Beautiful Tomorrow" in the northeastern corner of Fuxingmen, these flowerbeds represent the glorious achievements of New China in various fields in the past 70 years, and show the people's happy life.
This year's green environment layout makes full use of its own innovative achievements and integrates new varieties and new technologies at home and abroad, the officials of Beijing Landscape and Landscape Bureau said.
Overall application of more than 230 varieties, including 16 self-cultivated varieties, 18 green resistant new varieties and 11 native plants.
Three chrysanthemum varieties of " cold dew race glow " " gorgeous autumn candy " colorful autumn colorful " were first applied in China.
In order to welcome the National Day, Beijing has also recently carried out a comprehensive renovation of the landscape environment of the city, replanting more than 12,000 trees, 230,000 shrubs and 2.3 million square meters of grass roots and flowers.
At the same time, 200 themed flowerbeds, 20 million potted plants (plants) were set up in important areas such as the city's Circular Road, Chang'an Street Extension Line, Xiangshan Memorial Area, the perimeter of the new airport and the periphery of important tourist attractions.

New China Time Review: Steadfastly Walk Our Own Way
The basic reason for China's success in development in the past 70 years is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct path of development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the historical choice and the people's choice that China takes the road of development that suits itself.
In modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness and internal and external troubles, a generation of benefactors and scholars sought and continued to seek the way to save the country and save the people.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system and the presidential system have all been considered and tried and failed."
Only with the CPC and the new China did the Chinese people gradually carve out a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road China has taken is the road of happiness for the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and the rest of the world.
It is precisely because it is on the right path that China can do its own thing well and become the world's second-largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth that it can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the White Paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and in line with the requirements of the times, will show more and more bright prospects for development with the advance of the times.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right way. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right way even more.
The Chinese people understand the reason of Nan tangerine north brier and understand that what suits others is not necessarily right for themselves, only right for themselves is the best.
It is with this kind of road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has achieved the miracle that attracts worldwide attention.
In the tortuous course of mankind's advance, the "final conclusions of history" were once famous.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics proclaims the end of the historical conclusion, the collapse of the Chinese collapse theory, and the failure of the socialist failure theory.
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving national prosperity and strengthening the people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for countries and ethnic groups in the world that want to speed up development while maintaining their independence.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose the path of development suited to their national conditions.
Instead of "importing" the foreign model or "exporting" the Chinese model, China will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges of governance and government with other countries and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance.
The boss of a Foodworks supermarket has been slammed as "disgraceful" after the Fair Work Commission found he fired a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he preferred to hire staff from Asian backgrounds.
The commission said that Gianbin Wang, owner of Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagama Wagga store for more than 20 years, had treated employees in a "deeply unfair" manner and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the shop in 2016, had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the Commission, conducted a search on the Internet and found "some job advertisements that Mr. Wang has posted in the past at various Australian Chinese employment forums".
One of the job requirements listed in these positions said "Asian lady of choice" and the other said "Asian employee of choice".
A third post said he was "more inclined to overseas people [sic]. "
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton in April by text message, which he later said was due to her absence and allegedly a small cash shortage ranging from $5.10 to $30 at the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
For three years she had missed only one shift, and the "missed amount" amounted to several Australian dollars.
He said Ms Ayton's dismissal had "nothing to do with her behaviour or behaviour" .
"In my opinion, the respondent's real motivation for firing her, supported by evidence of a job advertisement by Mr. Wang, was his preference to hire someone with an Asian background," he said.
Under section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct ostensibly constitutes a breach of anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant is unlawful."
Mr Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr Wang to consider reinstating Ms Ayton in view of her "appalling" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a casual worker who earns A$26 an hour.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Mr. Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the commission's supervisor to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang, he said, did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged firing.
He said: "I believe that the respondent has taken an irredeemably unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and that Mr. Wang "waits" for this opportunity, which he believes will 'justify' the termination of employment.
"He was wrong ... the respondent completely ignored any natural and impartial treatment given to the applicant when he dismissed her, and it is appalling that he behaved in a disrespectful and grossly unfair manner."
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks was a small business, "it must be frankly stated that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case".
He said: "It is disgraceful and deeply unfair."

Six denied involvement in sale of bogus toilet paper to High Court
Six men, including an Assistant Registrar-General of the State Registration Office and a businessman of the rank of Governor, were suspected of forging and selling Chinese passports, newspaper papers and identity cards. On Thursday, the court heard that the anti-trafficking and anti-immigration charges were transferred to the High Court.
The defence lawyer representing the defendant, Mr Lai Chun-wah, who was also a Sunset Hole congressman, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant, i.e. no longer representing the defendant, and was cleared by the court.
He said he had drawn criticism from political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his Action Party had been implicated.
He stressed that he himself was not afraid of any threat, but that he did not want to be used by irresponsible units to stigmatize the UNOSOM and the Greek governments or other Greek leaders, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He added that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of parliament and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants. So far, the defendant, Mr Lai Chun-wah, has not been convicted.
The six defendants, charged on September 12 this year, faced charges under section 26E of the Anti-Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking Immigration Ordinance and section 466 of the Criminal Code (forged documents), which denied guilt and were not granted bail pending trial.
On Thursday, two court judges, Noosaha and Madeleine, gave the go-ahead for the prosecution to move the six defendants' allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-immigration laws to the high court, whereas the forgery charges will appear in court on October 3 pending the prosecution's handing over of documents to the defence.
The six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 ( SOSMA), so the judge refused bail.

Vietnam should seize the opportunity of artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank the level of readiness of cities to face the AI wave include perspectives, realisation capabilities, asset base and direction of development.
Singapore was ranked number one, followed by the UK, the US, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
"When I look back and evaluate Vietnamese cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, I think it makes a lot of sense," Oliver Wyman, an expert on the organization, told reporters.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is bright against a backdrop of high growth, a strong economic development path and a fast-growing talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important for Viet Nam to know how to use the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote greater economic development."
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but also threatens to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for a breakthrough in the age of artificial intelligence.

China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Chenjun Pan, senior animal protein analyst at the ABN Co-operative Bank in China, said demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, now accounting for 27 per cent of the world's pork imports and 24 per cent of the world's beef imports.

World's oldest hairdresser dies at 108. Haircut 96 years old
New York's Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest certified hairdresser, never retired to cut his hair every day, but Mancinelli died Sunday of complications of jaw cancer, saying goodbye to his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mr. Mancinelli immigrated to the United States when he was eight years old and soon helped clean the floor at a barbershop, where he began to take scissors at the age of 12 to serve his guests, reducing the financial strain on his family.
Mancinelli did not graduate, although he attended elementary school at the time.
Mr. Mancinelli's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved his job and people from all over the world loved him, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work for six weeks before his death because he planned to come back for a haircut when he got better.
Robert, 82, said he now had to find a new hairdresser after his father died because he had asked him to help cut his hair all his life.
Repurchase of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan during the year - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the company's share price and preserve its image, listed companies began to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years, hoping to pass the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market through targeted buybacks and aggregated bidding deals, thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Share buybacks by listed companies jumped to 51 billion yuan in 2018 from 7.9 billion yuan in 2017, according to Oriental Wealth Choice, and the total amount of buybacks by listed A-shares has exceeded 100 billion yuan since 2019, the highest level in the history of A-share buybacks and well ahead of previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the repurchase of shares appears to be the same as the increase of the major shareholders, but there are great differences in the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, the use of the repurchase, the equity of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Wing Information Consultancy Co., told the Securities Daily that the "opinions on supporting share repurchase by listed companies" issued in November 2018, addressed problems in the current system of share repurchase with a narrow scope, complicated decision-making process and inadequate inventory system.
In January, SSE and Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the Implementation Rules for Share Repurchase by Listed Companies, which broadened the sources of funds for share repurchase by listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided improved governance arrangements and encouraged various listed companies to implement stock incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the opinion is published, listed companies to carry out share repurchase operations, there are more applicable circumstances, easier repurchase process, share repurchase enthusiasm is also greater.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thus increasing the level of earnings per share, raising net asset yields and reducing pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
Compared with the large shareholders, the share repurchase of listed companies is more significant, and also reflects the willingness of the listed companies to active market capitalization management and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang argues that undervalued share prices are a major factor in the buybacks of listed companies, whose share prices no longer reflect the company's future prospects. Therefore, such companies deserve investors' attention, but they should not invest blindly and should pay attention to the financial statements of such listed companies as well as their specific operations.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate the company's development confidence and capital strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for share buybacks in A-listed companies has also normalized the practice, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have already implemented share buybacks this year and industry-leading companies have become the mainstays of the buyback market.
Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying the company had bought back 57.59 million shares of A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total equity, through a centralized bidding transaction, and that the total amount of funds paid totaled 5 billion yuan, excluding transaction fees, which would be used exclusively for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to long-term service plans already considered by the company's shareholders' general meeting.
Erie has paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase and recently made changes to its planned use of share repurchase, which would have been used entirely as a source of late-stage share incentives, to "a cumulative share repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares would have been used as a source of equity incentives and the remaining 30.49 million shares would have been written off to reduce registered capital".
Illi shares said the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares was conducive to a further increase in earnings per share and a real increase in the returns of shareholders.
TCL Group has repurchased 3.59 percent of the company's shares at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan, according to a September 25 announcement of the repurchase progress.
TCL's board office told Securities Daily the share buybacks would be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established management strategy, continuously improves the competitiveness, sustains the healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the maintenance of investors' interests, the company plans to use its own capital, self-financing and other financing methods to repurchase its shares, taking into account the performance of the secondary market in the past year.
Yang Delong, a former chief economist at Haikaiyuan Fund, said the repurchase of shares by listed companies could reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase earnings per share for listed companies, which is an important boon for share prices in the secondary market, and the willingness of listed companies to voluntarily fork out genuine gold and silver to buy back shares from the stock market for write-offs had greatly boosted confidence.
The repurchase of listed companies in China has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the outstanding shares, and it is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchase, which is also worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of Hunan Province and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee of the People's Republic of China (CPC) Central Committee of China.
To build a world-leading cluster of engineering machinery industries in Changsha is, in the current fashion, to create " the strongest surface. "
As the capital city of the inland province, Changsha shouted out this heroic words.
On the strength of the hegemonic side leak.
The four engineering machinery companies participating in the dialogue are well-versed, covering the whole fields of the sky, the earth, the sea and the land: Shanhe intelligent light aircraft, the CIC heavy concrete pumps, Trinity all-ground cranes, iron heavy construction tunnel shield construction machinery, its "hard power" can be said to be unique and arrogant.
Once upon a time, China had little say in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
Time flies, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go abroad" double-wheel drive, take advantage of the east wind of "<unk>" initiative, such as acquisition, merger, plants, etc., has become the world's leading engineering machinery industry.
Among them, Trinity Heavy Industries, China Unicom Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, Shanghe Intelligence and other leading engineering machinery enterprises, whose output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators have been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
It's camera-driven timing.
The "Four Great King Kongs" of the engineering machinery industry of Hunan Army is the leader of the Changsha engineering machinery industry cluster and the head of the global engineering machinery industry.
Who survives and lives well in the quack and quack of the global industry is the tough talk.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter, a number of well-known international engineering machinery manufacturers have fallen, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturers "cat winter" as a "winter swim", self-exerting pressure, self-breaking, through the industrial structure of the transition from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only survived, but also strengthened the body.
With all the stars in the moon, the government and enterprises to help.
The development of advantageous industries requires not only enterprises to be aggressive, but also governments to be active.
Changsha has the reputation of "engineering machinery capital" because it brings together the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates many related industrial clusters, and greatly reduces the cost of research and development, manufacturing and sales of enterprises by optimizing the business environment, perfecting supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises poured in.
History has pushed Changsha to the foreground of building the world's leading engineering machinery.
Whether the government, enterprises, or even relevant producers and researchers should seize the opportunity to advance in line with the times, determine the goal, make sustained efforts and contribute to the building of a strong country in Hunan.

The 58-year-old villager, Xia Weili, fills a trough in the sheep pen with the last shovel of grass and stands by the trough to watch the white lake goat chew.
It's delicious. You can't sell a good price until the autumn and winter months are full of fat.
He said he fed the sheep "special nutritional meals" every day, cleaned them regularly, sterilized them and waited on them carefully to avoid neglecting them.
Shavili kept sheep for more than 20 years until he came to the cooperative to work, did not know how rough sheep used to be.
Xia Weili is a native of Xia and Waterlogging Pool Village, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional methods of loose-breeding, poor quality of sheep, small out of the column.
In June, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and all began to change.
Havili kept his head down all day to breed, for he kept a stiff upper lip in his heart.
The shareholders are all poor households, they trust the sheep to the cooperative, the end of the year will be able to pay dividends, sell the price, but they are counting on him.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned to prevent the disease, mastered scientific feeding, and became the village's few breeding "good handful" .
The Yimin Farming Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lakes.
Zou Tao, head of the cooperative, said the standardized sheep shed has doorways inside and outside.
"The wool is thick enough to breed germs, and the sheep cannot stay in stifling, humid places. The sheep shed must be built on three sides of a ditch, and a fan must be fitted to ventilate and dissipate the heat.
In order to prevent the epidemic, Zou Tao said, the sheep shed must also be periodically sprayed disinfection, give the sheep three to four times in the first quarter of the vaccine.
In addition to living well, Little Sheep has to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheatgrass, alfalfa, etc., and has a wide enough playground to stretch its muscles.
Cooperatives adopt the methods of trusteeship and substitution to guide local farmers to put good-seeded lakes and sheep here, to raise, manage and sell them in a unified way, and to realize breeding, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 impoverished households with sheep shares pay more than 6000 yuan a year in dividends per household.
From Manshan grazing to precision feeding, from local mating to artificial insemination, from looking at size and groping one belly to doing B-ultra one by one In Qingyang, Gansu, meat and sheep farming is not just a change in feeding patterns.
'If market prices are weak, the leading local company, Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Pasturage Development Co., Ltd., will buy at a market-protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk,' Mr. Zou said.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pasturage Development Co. Ltd., said the enterprises have driven more and more poor households to read the Goat Sutra by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, quotation acquisition and unified processing services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 impoverished families have achieved steady increases in their incomes through feeding, breeding, scale breeding, slaughter division and market sales.
Qingyang city is located in the north agriculture and animal husbandry interlaced zone, rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale meat and sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million meat and sheep raised, and two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processing lines have been set up.
France's finance minister says tax cuts will exceed 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
(Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year and Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive its sluggish economy, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing measures created an opportunity for more investment by the able member governments.
The ECB cut interest rates to a record low on Sept. 12 and plans to restart debt purchases in a bid to drive down borrowing costs, hoping to spur a recovery and boost inflation.
"Low interest rates will not bring prosperity back to Europe, monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient, " Lemel told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, and now it needs to, the sooner the better. Don't wait until things get worse, " he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, providing a big boost to its economic growth.
Germany, which depends on exports, bears the brunt of the loss of momentum in the global economy.
Le Maire pointed out that the tax burden on French households would be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax cuts.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros over a five-year period as the company tax rate is phased in from 33.3 percent to 25 percent.
He recently issued important instructions on the protection of the memorial facilities for the martyrs, stressing that the planning, construction, repair, management and maintenance of the martyrs' mausoleum should be strengthened.
In order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the important instruction and work hard to promote the protection and management of the memorial facilities for martyrs, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, the General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the Central Military Commission have recently issued the General Work Plan for the Planning, Construction, Repair, Management and Maintenance of the memorial facilities for martyrs.
The Program of Work is a programmatic document for the protection and management of the memorial facilities for martyrs, defines the objectives of the protection and management of the memorial facilities for martyrs, proposes plans for the construction of the memorial facilities for martyrs, and improves the system of education bases to carry forward the spirit of martyrs; repairs and protects the memorial facilities for martyrs and creates a strong social atmosphere that honors the memory of heroes; and manages and maintains the memorial facilities for martyrs, thus forming a standardized organizational safeguard and management system.

Study: Slight increase in U.S. National Health Eating Index, but still challenging - CUNY
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown moderately in 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new study.
But with a perfect score of 100, it's not a cause for celebration.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and one of the study's authors, said Americans still eat too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes and obesity, among the most common diseases in the U.S. population.
The study was published 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on the U.S. government's health survey of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors wrote that "significant dietary challenges persist despite considerable improvements".
The challenges are understood to include reducing the consumption of foods containing saturated fats such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows and butter.
The study found that people's dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended limit of 10 percent.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but still too high.
Officials believe that the amount of added sugar in the diet should be less than 10%.
As for the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, the researchers linked it to a decrease in people's consumption of sweet fizzy drinks, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adult consumption of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain types of foods in the United States has increased slightly.
However, figures for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5 percent of the diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt consumption and a reduction in fruit juice consumption, Zhang said they still account for as much as 42 percent of the daily calories, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on biannual personal health surveys that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have been asking the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Dietary Guidelines for American Residents recommend adopting a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutrient-intensive foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seeds that provide protein.
The number of Americans living with diabetes nearly doubled to more than 7 percent during the study period, and the obesity rate has increased over the years - about 70 percent of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death for Americans.

Earlier this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new management technology system, with the help of technology and digital means to enhance management's product development and wind control capabilities.
The new system starts with four major capabilities: product design, sales transaction, asset management and risk assessment, and improves the overall intellectualized operation level of the management industry.
Experts believe that management technology, while enhancing customer service capability and enriching products, can also enhance risk prevention capability and improve management efficiency.
Mr Zhang said the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits had helped better locate customers and launch products tailored to their investment preferences, helping to mitigate risks.
"External big data such as electricity generation and spatiotemporal data can help us to better delineate the activity and prosperity of an area, an industry. "
While mitigating the risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities, Zhang said.
Record deepest shaft in China railway tunnel set
Zhang Weiming Xu Zhou Jingbo completed the construction of shaft 1 of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel at Jiandao Rui Railway on September 27 after more than 1,200 days of day-and-night construction. The shaft reached 762.59 meters below ground level, beating the record for the deepest shaft in China's railway tunnel, which was set under heavy flooding.
The 34.5 km-long Darius Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, located in Yunnan Province, crosses the Gaoligong Mountains from the Jiangxi shore of Anger, making it the longest single tunnel on a double-line in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 meters because it covers almost all the potentially undesirable geology and significant risks associated with tunnel construction.
The vertical shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan tunnel, which shoulders the important task of increasing the working surface to realize the "long tunnel short span" and the late railway operation ventilation.
The successful excavation of shaft No.1 signals the formal entry of the tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction. After excavation and equipment replacement, four additional working surfaces can be added to the shaft to speed up tunnel excavation.
"Shafts are all in the granite formation because there are so many cracks in the granite formation that the water can't be stopped.
Si Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Da Rui Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, mud gush, water collapse and other hazards occurred many times.
"At the height of the shaft inrush, the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep at the bottom of the well, more than 300 cubic meters per hour. "
" If we don't pump and drain the water in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters an hour, nearly 85 percent of the time and 15 percent of the time.
In order to overcome the geological difficulties such as longitudinal joint development, mud gushing, water-rich granite and so on, tunnel construction adopts systemic water control measures combining "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No.1 shaft has formed mechanical assembly lines such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch hoisting system.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the shaft was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 meters.
With a length of 330 kilometers, the Darui Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "China-Myanmar" railway.
Upon completion and opening, the journey time between Dali and Ruili will be reduced from six hours on the highway to two hours, greatly improving the transportation pattern in the western part of Yunnan and contributing to the promotion of economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Detailed to go out to do a few things, the characteristics of Type A blood become stronger and stronger, they feel very awkward.
Take a suit, buy nutrients, pay, buy sashimi, Nana's snacks.
Above is the reason to go out.
On the phone, just to my sister love roses thanks to Nana, or even the excuse for small snacks lost.
There was a few perfunctory laughs over there, saying that the child had called and hung up.

Her husband, Beau, seldom came back early.
Lian praised the salmon salad with butternuts and went to the bedroom to lie in bed and watch TV.

Wash a bunch of grapes from friends, save half for BOO, the rest in a favorite little flower bowl, take out to see the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skin, and I threw up the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, the good thing is that the clouds are walking, the moon suddenly appears, a light and dark but some harsh.
The poems about the bright moon were in my head, and I liked them only so clearly: every three or five days I would be reunited / full of clear jade bars / the last round in the sky would be held / the last round in the sky would be full of clear jade bars / the last round of the world would look up.
Perhaps we give too much emotion to the moonlight, for now I come to say, in fact, that God to God, Caesar to Caesar is the best.
The moonlight returns to the moonlight, the mood belongs to yourself.
After eating the grapes, the cold moon was chilly.
With a slight snore at her feet, Nana stood up and spread Nana's little blanket over the edge of her little house, on which Nana lay happily.
Opening the door, he shouted, Is the bath water ready
You can't see the moon from the bathroom window. You can only feel the moonlight. Turn off the bathroom light and open the glass.
No moon cakes, no wine.

Does Ma Hua take part in the by-election for the conference seat in Dentsubee, Johor?
Governor of the Association of Ma Hua, Governor Sri Wei Jiaxiang: " To the Supreme Council of the National Front for discussion! "
The by-election in the seat of Thanvet Biai is a matter of concern for the traditional seat of Ma Hua, a member of the National Front party.
However, after a meeting of the MCA Central Committee, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional MCA seat should be continued or replaced by other member parties.
Speaking to the media after chairing a meeting of the China Council of Ma Hua on Thursday afternoon, Mr Wei said any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which is to be finalised only after the meeting of the National Front's Supreme Council.
He said the meeting of the National Front's Supreme Council is expected to take place in early October because the electoral commission will meet only next Monday to finalize the by-election for the seat of Than Shwebyai.
"Yesterday morning (26th) I also met with Governor Sri Amanzadeh, chairman of the National Front, and we all agreed on the need to retake the seat from the Alliance of Hope. "
"We have decided to convene a special meeting of the leaders of the National Front in early October, and the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will decide which of the member parties will take up the leadership. "
Asked whether he would insist on taking up the traditional seat in the National Front's Supreme Council, Mr Wei reiterated that, as head of the National Council, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures.
"It's not uncommon in any by-election for someone to go out, to have a political party, to have someone think they should go out. "
The most important thing is what organization and political union do we come from?
"This is a great test of how we have for years formed a political coalition, and we believe that the BN has carried some valuable values along the way. "
"It's no surprise that someone might say something along the way. "
"But once the decision of the Supreme Council of the National Front is taken, all must be ready for war, and that is the most precious thing. "
In any case, Mr. Wei said, Mr. Ma will devote all his efforts to preparing for the upcoming by-election in Than Shwe Biai with three levels, namely the district council, the state council and the central government.
"The District Council will be headed by Governor Sri Wong-sun, Chairman of the District Council (Danvelbeai); the State Board will be headed by Governor Lin Pei-hing, Acting Chairman of the Luzhou Board of Governors; and the Central Committee will be personally deployed by Governor-General Nah Nahshon and Governor-General Zhang Sheng-heung-heung.

A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province has been ordered to hunt for wildlife.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15420 yuan (RMB, same below) in compensation for environmental damages to ecological resources.
Because the defendant's family is impoverished, the procuratorial organ uses substitute labor to compensate the ecological restoration cost, and realizes the organic unification of legal effect and social effect.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy prosecutor general of the Baokang County Prosecutor's Office, said Wednesday that through three months of "compulsory mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, defendant Zhou Mou has formed a deep relationship with wild macaques and felt deeply remorseful for hunting animals.
On June 21, a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit filed by the Baokang County Prosecutor's Office in the field of ecological resources was heard in a county court and sentenced on the spot.
Defendant Chow was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of 3 years, suspended for 4 years and fined 3,000 yuan, and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan in compensation for environmental damages to ecological resources.
Zhou installed a power grid at the cliffs since late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wildlife, including impala, chamois, fur-roofed deer and so on.

UN awards Ant Forest the Guardian of the Earth Award
Amid enthusiastic applause and huge music, Ant Forest project leader Xu Flute and user representative Shen Junliang stepped onto the podium to receive the 2019 United Nations Earth Defender Award trophy from the hosts.
The Ant Forest Project, which uses mobile phone programs to motivate hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental initiatives, won the prize on Tuesday in New York, USA.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in Kenya's capital Nairobi, but the crowd at the ceremony was still struggling to hide their excitement.
" Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing mankind and what mankind can do for the environment," UNEP Executive Director Ine Andersen told Xinhua.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in the preservation of the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
Launched in August 2016 on Alipay platform by the China Ant Financial Services Group, users accumulate "green energy" and "plant trees" on their mobile phones through low-carbon initiatives such as recording green trips to their daily lives in Ant Forest and paying for water and electricity online.
Every time a user develops a virtual tree, Ant Forest and its public welfare partners plant a real tree in a desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million Ant Forest users had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica's president, Carlos Alvarado, who won the prize for his country's environmental efforts, praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, "for inspiring so many people to participate in green action. "
The Guardians of the Earth Award is an affirmation of the Ant Forest project, said Jixiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ants Golden Clothes.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, an honor that belongs to all participants.
The ant forest has affected 500 million people in the past three years, and the goal over the next three years is to get one billion people involved in low-carbon operations around the world, Mr Jii said.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how farmers can earn more from green hills and rivers.
Besides providing employment opportunities through tree planting, we hope to help farmers increase their income through agricultural product development projects, electricity generation platforms and so on.
The model of digital-based public welfare environmental protection created by Ant Forest has also been successfully launched for reference by other countries.
In June, GCash, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, unveiled a Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
GCash, in partnership with the Philippines Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental groups, plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, the ministry said.
The "Guardian of the Earth Award" is the United Nations' highest award in the field of environmental protection, awarded annually.
" Ant Forest" won the prize for the third year in a row, following the construction of the Saihanba Forestry Farm in Zhejiang Province, China's "thousand village demonstration, Wancun rehabilitation" project.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy.
US gross domestic product growth slowed markedly from the previous quarter, hurt by a sharp fall in private-sector investment and exports, according to the US second-quarter report.
Analysts cited trade frictions and uncertainty as the main cause of the decline in private-sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
Final revised data released on the 26th by the Commerce Department showed U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, unchanged from the revised figures released earlier but significantly below the 3.1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.
The data showed that consumer growth was the main factor supporting U. S. growth in the second quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 percent in the quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumer spending and investment fueled economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down growth of 1.16 percentage points in the quarter, while exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter and net exports dragged down growth of 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.
Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironside Macroeconomic Consulting, said private-sector investment fell sharply instead of sustaining the momentum of last year's growth, as trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Mr Knapp believes U. S. corporate capital spending is still expected to fall next year amid policy uncertainty.
Analysts say that while consumer growth provided a strong boost to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have hurt consumer confidence and adversely affected the outlook for U.S. consumption.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers voluntarily mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest rate in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who led the study.
Analysts widely expect the U. S. economy to continue to slow down in the future.
But experts say the performance of the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions ease.
UK economists think-tank Global Economist Kathleen Birch expects the US economy to continue a gradual downturn this year and grow at a slower pace than it did in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year and slow further to 1.6 percent next year, assuming that economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate.
Alan Hatzen, investment manager at Patnam Investments, says the biggest concern for companies today is trade and economic disputes and the uncertainty they cause. If they are resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the industry sector will perform much better than it does today.
Matt Melly, equity strategist at Miller-Taback Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions remain the "primary issue" and the main cause of the volatility in U.S. capital markets this year, and whether they can be properly addressed will be key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
First-ever parental leave for couples in Ningxia can be taken by parents of children aged 0 to 3 for 10 days a year
Safeguarding women's lawful rights and interests is the embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights and an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
At the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th NPC Standing Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on September 27, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by high votes.
This is the first provincial-level regulations promulgated in Ningxia to safeguard women's legitimate rights and interests in a comprehensive and systematic way, and will be formally implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations were revised on the basis of the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests in Ningxia Province in 2007, and are divided into nine chapters, 65 articles, including general rules, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
Under the Regulations, Ningxia is the first countrywide initiative to encourage the exploration of joint parental leave for couples.
In April, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guidance Notes on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children under 3 Years of Age.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has put forward an innovative proposal to "encourage the employing units to give the couples 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of zero and three to couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlighted the anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations draws on the latest legislative achievements in the codification of personality rights in China's civil code, and elaborates the constitutional elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the recurrent and vicious sexual assault of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, thus becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
In view of women's right to know and deal with the common property of marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration institutions and related subjects, and provides solid institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, Article 26 of the Regulations prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, taking into account the latest experience in joint talks, strengthening penalties for sexist violations, and more vigorously safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Department of Public Prosecution and Public Prosecution of Ningxia Women's Federation, civil affairs and other departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing social professional force in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and anti-domestic violence work.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.Many laws and regulations encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Academician Yuan Longping Working Station of Xing'an League of Inner Mongolia Salt-resistant and Alkali-Resistant Rice Yielding Rice Permu Yields Broken Chicks
Reporter 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xing'an League administrative office learned that the Union recently held "Xing'an's academician Yuan Longping workstation salinity-resistant alkaline rice field survey and acceptance of the evaluation committee, salt-resistant alkali-resistant rice average acre yield of more than a kilo of rice.
A group of 6 experts from Heilongjiang Agricultural Science Academy, Yangzhou University and Hunan Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department, sampled and harvested "Xing salt series" of rice on site.
The average yield of salt-tolerant alkali-tolerant rice was 508.8 kilograms per mu on land with pH values of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity content of 5? to 6?.
"Our next step is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's experiments, and to breed and optimize salt-tolerant alkaline rice varieties again so that the quality is better and the yield is higher," said Wang Shigang, executive director of the workstation of Professor Yuan Longping of UNITA.
Li Yongcai, vice-president and researcher of Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and head of the expert group on production measurement, said: "With the constant factors of production, I think the continuous strengthening of science and technology, salt-tolerant and alkaline rice will continue to produce miracles on saline and alkaline land.
Xing'an League belongs to the southern foothills of Daxing'anling concentrated area with special difficulties.
In October 1998, Academician Yuan Longping worked as a license plate holder for UNITA.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and popularization of the newly cultivated "salt-resistant alkaline hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technology, and to build 960 mu of salt-resistant alkaline rice base in the middle flag of Korqin's right wing.
The field measurement of salt-resistant alkaline rice not only provides scientific basis for raising low- and medium-yield fields of Xing'an alkaline salt-resistant rice to inject hope into high-yield fields, but also for saline-alkaline rice cultivation under the same conditions in China.
After marathon debates and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed an abortion legalization bill on September 26, local time, Australia.com reported.
The legislation is understood to have sparked political debate in the past eight weeks, with the Australian Liberal Party deeply divided since independent MP Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of deliberation, the ANZ Senate voted 26 to 14 to legalise abortion on Friday night, making it the third-longest-running bill in the state Senate, the report said.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the New State House of Representatives, abortion was legalized in the state.
The bill allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation and, if two doctors agree, an abortion later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment Friday night that would allow doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of the hospital's advisory committee before performing an abortion on a woman 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the Senate approved amendments to include the need for doctors to provide adequate care for babies who survive pregnancy terminations.
New Gov. Berry Gichlin, who has faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill, stepped in several times to get more debate time for the bill, but did not show up for the final vote.
Berry Gichlin defended her absence from the polls, saying, " I need to take the time to run the whole new state. "
Australian Liberal MP David Davis is understood to have been the most vocal opponent of the abortion bill, threatening to quit the state government and calling it a "government crisis" .
But then Davis backed down.
Davis said: "The contents of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provide more protection for women and doctors."
Meanwhile, National Party of Australia leader Barry Lauro said he was proud to be part of a government that would legalize abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the state, legalizing abortion, making abortion no longer a crime, and treating women who have abortions like criminals. "
Trinity Group's major project landed in Zhuzhou.
A total of 15 billion yuan was invested to focus on the development of the petroleum intelligent equipment and intelligent steel industry.
Today, the Zhuzhou Municipal People's Government and Trinity Group held a project signing ceremony.
Trinity has invested 15 billion yuan to develop industrial projects in Zhuzhou such as the Intellectual Steel Industry, the Petroleum Intelligent Equipment and Regional Research and Development Center (Headquarters Base), and the second-hand automobile market for engineering machinery, with an annual combined output value of over 200 billion yuan.
The site of the $10 billion Trinity Intellectual Steel Industry Project will focus on building the largest steel and product trading center in the province and even the central part of the region, as well as the Trinity Group Intelligent Manufacturing and Processing Center for Metal Structure Components.
At the same time, Trinity Group will also build an engineering machinery used car market in Chibok Garden in Zhuzhou High-tech Zone and develop practical cooperation in intelligent manufacturing.
Zhuzhou City attaches great importance to cooperation with Trinity Group.
The city listed the cooperation project as "Project No.1," which attracted investment from the city this year.Mao Tengfei, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and Yang Weiguo, mayor of the city, led the way in setting up a special coordination group to effectively dock and advance high-level.
Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state funds to enrich social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, totaling about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said.
Liu Kun was convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State-funded Commission to transfer some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund of the work of the deployment of the above-mentioned statements.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, to fully embody the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system.
In 1995, the State Council issued the Implementation Program for Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds, which required the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, positive results have been achieved in the pre-stage transfer work.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of the central financial institutions of the Ministry of Finance to perform the duties of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the enterprise transfer pre-stage work has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had basically been completed, transferring state-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.8 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successively carried out preparatory work for the transfer, for the next implementation of the transfer laid the foundation.
According to a joint notice issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-funded Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the central and local transfer of some state-owned capital-enriched social security funds will be fully pushed aside in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting convened that day resulted in a concrete deployment for the complete departure of the transfer.
It was emphasized that the transfer should be done in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will have to be basically completed by the end of 2020.
It's a tight schedule and a lot of work. "
Liu said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and arrange arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the contents of the transfer policy, strengthen communication and coordination and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
State-funded Transfer to Enrich Social Security Fund Starting with a "enrichment of the Social Security Fund's coffers," the goal is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author thinks that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement" , but the opening of "mathematical addition" .
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Services, the State-funded Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the "Notice Concerning the Comprehensively Pushing Away the Work of Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds," clarifying the timetable for transferring some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, i.e. the work of the Central Government and local government transferring some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in 2019.
With the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments have also been quick to implement.
On Sept. 25, the Treasury transferred all 10 percent of its holdings in ICBC and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with the two holdings worth more than $115 billion.
According to the regulations, social security foundations and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the rights of income, disposal and knowledge of the state-owned shares.
In the announcement, ICBC and ABC said the change in interests will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this connection, the author thinks that the equity transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but a series of "additional operations" that can inspire a series of effects.
The first step of transferring the social security of some state-owned enterprises, the "Additional Results", can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people and the sharing of the development results by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously achieved to do better and to do greatly and strongly.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to postpone the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in a comprehensive manner this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would, in accordance with the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, do a good job in pushing aside the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, fully embodying the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises by all.
The second step, "Additional Results", is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the social security system for the aged.
As the population ages, China's social security funds are under pressure. Most of the state funds that have been transferred have the capability of sustained profits and dividends, not only to replenish social security funds effectively, but also to provide a source of living water for social security funds.
Measurements show that for every 3.8 percentage points transfer of state-owned capital, the share of enterprises' basic old-age insurance deposits can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third "additional result" of the transfer is the addition of stabilizers to the capital market.
The main way of transferring the subject to receive the income is " Dividend mainly, operation as auxiliary. "
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, social security funds do receive dividends mainly from equity stakes.
However, social security funds, as value investors in the capital market, have a strong capability of capital operation.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, facilitate the improvement of enterprise management level, and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase of equity stakes in social security funds is conducive to further strengthening its influence in the market and acts as a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to give full play to the function of "value discovery" of institutional investors and guide investors to invest rationally and valuefully.

Iran confirmed to have developed advanced centrifuges to further suspend implementation of Iran nuclear deal
September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to make uranium enrichment has violated the Iranian nuclear deal once again.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the limits of the Iran nuclear deal in response to U.S. President Barack Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, the resumption and tightening of sanctions.
The move comes after Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and to enrich uranium at less than 3.67 percent purity.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran has only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and only a handful of more advanced models are allowed for research without producing enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for use in nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the IAEA report states: "On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that the advanced centrifuges of the Iranian R&D Model 2 and Model 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency presented the report to Member States on 26 September, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the [Natanz enrichment] facility".

Italy's education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect people's health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, Italy's education minister and a member of the Five Star Movement, has tabled a motion in parliament proposing a new tax on sugary drinks, snacks and airfares.
The Italian government will introduce a snack tax on health-threatening food products such as sugary drinks and snacks, while imposing an environmental tax on airfares, 1 euro on domestic flights and 1 1/2 euros on international classes, according to a motion proposed by Education Minister Fior Lamonti.
Mr Fioramonti said the government could expect €3bn in taxes through what appeared to be a tiny set of measures.
Funds from the tax would be used in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.
Italian Prime Minister Antonio Conte said he thought it was a viable option, while Italian lawmaker, European lawmaker and Union party leader Matteo Salvini tweeted sarcastically: 'Please hide desserts, cookies, bread and sweets as the new government starts imposing a snack tax.
The snack tax is a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods, the report said.
The levy will contribute to the public health benefits.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper says that as China's overall national strength and international influence have risen rapidly, some international fears that China will follow the path of a "great national power and a strong national hegemony", and some have proposed what it calls "China's threat theory".
There are cognitive misogyny, deep-seated prejudices, psychological imbalances caused by strength loss, and deliberate distortions to protect one's vested interests.
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of the people of all countries, to realize national prosperity and strength, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.
China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, and China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth.
At present, the momentum of world economic growth is insufficient, and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is changing from high-speed growth to prosperity, with the acceleration of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, deep economic restructuring, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization and the emergence of new economic growth points.
"The McKinsey Institute of Global Studies study concludes that the integration of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to generate between US$ 22 trillion and US$ 37 trillion in economic value by 2040, equivalent to 15 per cent to 26 per cent of the global economy, and that increased cooperation between the rest of the world's economies and China will create enormous economic value."
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is good for the world's economic development in the long run.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain and decouple China from the world economy.
The White Paper points out that opening up to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share "China's dividend" .
China resolutely follows a win-win strategy of opening up to the outside world at a greater and higher level.China has the world's most promising consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination and benefits more countries on a larger scale.
“Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
" Mutual benefit is long - term lasting. "
The white paper says China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection.
Only when all sides are in line with each other can we create an open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced and win-win environment for development, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger to form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
Includes promoting high-quality cooperation and building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China has benefited from the development of the international community and has always given back to the family of nations and provided more and better public goods to the international community.
Russia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China in economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and diversify its exports to China, Andrey Slipnyov, general manager of the Russian Export Center, told Xinhua in a written interview recently.
The forestry, machinery and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russia's exports to China, while exports of agricultural products are also important, including fat products, meat products and dairy products, as well as grains, fish and seafood, Mr. Slipnyoff said.
In recent years, Russia's exports of non-materials and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development.
Talking about optimizing Russia's export structure to China, Mr. Sripnikov said Russia has set the task of expanding exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand of high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will then improve financial and non-financial support measures to further increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
The Russian side is ready to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and develop cooperation with China in pharmaceutical and aviation manufacturing fields, Sripnikov said.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas were "quality-advantageous and price-competitive" compared with their Western counterparts.
Referring to the two countries' goal of achieving 200 billion U.S. dollars in bilateral trade by 2024, Sripnikov said the fields of agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia intends to diversify its supply in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China is one direction.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises to "establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries".
The Russian export center is supporting the export of Russian products to China through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank through a variety of measures and services, Mr. Slipnyov said.
Meanwhile, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to facilitate more convenient access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and develop new types of exports to China.

Demonstration Bombs President Out of Office Egypt Rainstorms to Come Authorities Show Strong Repression
Twitter-themed labels and social media are urging Egyptians to take to the streets today to plead peacefully for President Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress it.
Since then-military chief Sethi seized power in a military coup in 2013, the expression of dissent has been almost silent in Egypt, and any form of protest is in extreme danger.
Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that Egypt's Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based non-governmental organization, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since a rare outbreak of protests over the weekend calling for Mr.
Corruption allegations surrounding Sethi and his family's profligate public pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to take to the streets since the 20th.
Egypt's Interior Ministry stood firm yesterday, saying it would resolutely meet any attempt to destabilize the country and would not be soft.
In downtown Cairo, already heavily guarded, streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's 2011 revolutionary detonation, are littered with riot police, security agencies vehicles and plainclothes police.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of leading academics and social scientists on the 25th, including the University of Cairo political science professor and prominent columnist Rafael Naffa.
On 24th he tweeted: "I have no doubt that continued absolute rule by Cecil would be disastrous."
It is in Egypt's interest that he step down at once.
The arrest follows the detention of Hosni, who served as a spokesman for Egypt's former army chief of staff, Annan.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Sethi for the presidency.
Daoud, president of the Constitutional Party, has also been detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that sweeping away dissent reflects government instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and middle class are intensifying.
The opposition leader, Ayman Nour, a former contender for the presidency, said: "The seizure underscores the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears. "
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, combined with widespread political oppression, Mr. Sethi is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who might take over. "
Mr. Knoll noted that government coercion only increases people's anger while the socioeconomic situation continues to deteriorate.
Now that the fear barrier has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, an exiled Spanish businessman and actor and former contractor for Egypt's military, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month that claimed to have benefited from government corruption, setting off small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, Amrak, does not have to go through the legal tender process to get lucrative contracts that emphasize corruption by the military and its loved ones, including First Lady Intisar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful of his involvement.
Ali claimed that his lavish palaces and luxury hotels were in stark contrast to the current Egyptian life of abject poverty, and that the other side had not paid.
Twitter has attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand that he step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amar Wake has nearly seven million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday he tweeted in Arabic: " Cecil is doomed ... he's doomed, his supporters are going to make a big mistake now. "

Participants will receive a special allowance of HK$4,000 per trainee per month as long as they have completed each full-time or part-time course and attended 80% of the courses.
The training course, which lasts two to three months and is offered by about 50 training institutions, can be read daily from October 3 to March 31, next year. Each person can apply for up to four courses, the spokesman said.

Exercise exhausts the mind, too?
According to a study of athletes, the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise, Russian satellite network RIA Novosti reported.
The study, led by Mathias Perciglione, an expert at the Petitjean-Salpetrier hospital in France, showed an unmistakable link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activity.
Perciglione explains: " You need to control the autonomous process that forces you to stop when you have muscle and joint pain. "

The school's experts guide athletes in preparing for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to develop overtraining syndrome, the uncontrollable feeling of tiredness after high-load exercise, unable to recover and declining performance.
INSEP raises the question: Can part of the problem be caused by nervous fatigue, the kind of nervous fatigue that results from overworked brains?
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

"One Interchange Always" Two Major UHV Projects Launched
26th, quasi-east to south Anhui ± 1100 kV high voltage DC transmission project, Sutong 1000 kV AC super high voltage GIL integrated tube corridor project operation.
Both of these projects occupy the high point in the field of current world power transmission technology and will greatly improve the large-scale optimized allocation of China's energy after shipment.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the State Energy Administration, said the project, from Quasi-East to South Anhui, was the world's largest and longest-distance transmission project.
Its operation is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring the electricity supply in east China.
GIL, gas insulation metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong Gallery project set the record for the highest voltage rating and the strongest conveying capacity in the world by GIL engineering.
According to the State Grid Company, the transmission distance between the quasi-east and southern Anhui provinces is 3324 kilometers long.
With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of electricity would be lost on the road, and the project has been developed and developed to greatly increase the economic distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.
After the quasi-east to south Anhui project is put into operation, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of eliminating new energy in Xinjiang.
At full capacity, the line alone would deliver between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to meet more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL Comprehensive Tube Gallery Project is a controlled project of the ultra-high voltage AC loop network across the Yangtze River.
Using conventional overhead routes to cross the river requires the erection of two giant 450-meter-plus towers along the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island the size of four football fields for each tower.
To this end, the National Grid bold innovation, the development of compact ultra-high-voltage AC GIL transmission technology from underwater tunnels across the river, avoiding the impact on the golden channel.
Two projects promoted China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity to achieve a new leap forward.
At present, the National Grid has been built a cumulative "10-to-11-straight" ultra-high voltage project, as well as "4-to-3-straight" in the construction.

White Paper: China Takes a Road of Development that Meets the National Conditions
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council Information Office on Tuesday issued a white paper on China and the World in the New Era.
The white paper points out that in the past 70 years, the Chinese people have made arduous efforts to explore and carve out a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved development achievements that attract worldwide attention.
The white paper says China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development has depended on the spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" and generations have struggled ceaselessly, toiling and sweating unimaginably in the hands of others; on the spirit of "carrying its own burden" without passing on problems of prosperity or adversity, without passing on contradictions, without forcing buys and selling and plundering other countries; and on the spirit of exploration of "trying to cross the river with a stone", without taking the old path of imperialism or colonialism, without copying the development model of Western countries, but combining China's reality, experience, lessons learned and civilization, and daring to try its own way out.
According to the White Paper, China has developed through its interactions with the world, and China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development.
China safeguards world peace by practical actions.
For 70 years, China has not actively provoked any wars or conflicts, and has not encroached on an inch of other countries' land.
The white paper points out that the fundamental reason for China's great success in the past seven decades is to find the right way to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly follow it.
This is a way to establish, put people's interests first, reform and innovation, seek common development in opening up and administer the country in an all-round way in accordance with the law.
Without a centralized, united and strong leadership force, China's huge size and complex national conditions make governance difficult and rare, China will move towards fragmentation and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
Over the past 70 years, China has overcome all kinds of risks and challenges, creating one wonder after another that attracts worldwide attention, the White Paper says.
In particular, since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China has made historic achievements and undergone historic changes, and the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from rising to prosperity to strength, closer than at any time in history to the great goal of national rejuvenation.
China's development path will show more and more bright prospects as the times advance.

Chen Mingzhang, dean of the Taipei Institute of Management and Management, said trade frictions between China and the US continued and Taiwanese businessmen faced an "age of uncertainty".
He argues that Taiwanese businessmen need to keep pace with the times and keep abreast of the mainland's mainland industries, focusing in particular on innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
In the past, Taiwanese traders valued quality, effectiveness and delivery.
Chen Mingzhang believes that the above-mentioned conditions are not enough for Taiwanese businessmen at the moment.

New regulation seeks advice: social capital must be qualified to obtain rural land management right
The right to land management in rural areas should be qualified by social capital
"Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right" Publicly Seeks Opinions It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management right
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the "Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Draft Amendments for Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "Draft Opinions") for public comment, increasing the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital from industrial and commercial enterprises to land management rights.
The Draft Recommendations are open to the public for comments.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of separation of three powers, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures on the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Contracted Management Rights, thus forming the Draft Opinions.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters understand that the first published "Opinion Draft" has a number of important changes.
The newly amended Rural Land Contract Law clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three rights separation," sets up the "Right to Land Contract and Management" and "Right to Land Management" respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land contract and management rights (lease, subcontract, share ownership or other forms).
In order to implement the concept of "three powers separation", effectively respond to the tenor of the Revision of the Rural Land Contract Law, and take into account the great differences between the transfer of the right to land management and the exchange of the right to land contracted management, the transfer of the right to parties, procedures and supervision, this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of the right to land management, including the transfer of leases and shares, and changes the regulation name from the "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracted Management Rights to the "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights".
Measures for the transfer and exchange of the right to land contracted management will be formulated separately.
In the context of "three powers separation, " the draft opinion points out, farmers only have a fixed period of land management rights.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers are only at risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is no longer legally necessary to require the contracted land to be returned to the original contractor, and conflicts with the Bankruptcy Law.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing land, preferred shares, rented shares, buybacks and so on have arisen in practice.
Considering that preferred shares have matured theories in the company law, it is suggested as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of land loss.
