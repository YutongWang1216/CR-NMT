Women's volleyball is expected to defend the title of the World Cup ahead of schedule!
In the match against the Dutch women's volleyball team in two consecutive wins in the case of the opponents back to a city, the final 3:1 Rick Netherlands, ushered in nine consecutive wins.
The World Cup is drawing to a close and China's women's volleyball team can't afford to be taken lightly against Serbia, despite the prospect of defending its title.
In the first two sets of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team performed as strongly as ever, starting with 25:19, 25:16, until the third set, the team encountered setbacks.

The Dutch women's volleyball team is not to be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball team also prepared for the difficulties before the game, although lost a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's grasp, "with the strong team win and lose the game is normal, play five games is normal, so we said to the players to focus, Lang Ping said.
Fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the firepower open, a single game to get 8 points, for the team to win a great achievement.
China's women's volleyball team has already touched the Champions League trophy with one hand, but the match against the Netherlands did give the Chinese women's volleyball team a wake-up call: the more critical the moment, the more to go all out.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and the United States played five sets, the United States did not get all three points from the opponents, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team against Serbia in the game to get all three points, a round ahead of the realization of the defending title.
All kinds of situations are moving towards the advantageous situation of Chinese women's volleyball.
However, although Serbia's absence of all six major players does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the table, Serbia has largely lost the medals, which means they can "lighten up" against the Chinese women's volleyball team, put down the baggage to attack the opponents, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the title, the state may fluctuate.
In addition, the Serbian substitute team is not "anybody slaughtered" the lamb, before the Netherlands, the two sides in the previous five games, the Serbian team finally 3-2 reversed the Dutch main force line-up, thus the thickness of the line-up.
Before the start of the third stage, Lang Ping said neither team could handle it: "Osaka is going to be a very difficult game.
Now that the trumpet of defending the title has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white-hot stage".
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team are above their opponents, only the last critical moment, but also depends on whether the women's volleyball girls can play normal level, in the field to release themselves.

Yuan Longping devoted himself to rice research and cultivated good seeds all over the world so that more than one billion Chinese people would not be discouraged from laughing. He was also like an old peasant who liked to walk in the fields.
They, seeking benevolence, live simple, simple and persistent lives, so long as they immerse themselves in the foreigners do not understand and their broom self-preservation of the cause, it is easy to be happy, regardless of the reins of fame, wealth and glory.
Like Jin Yong's novels, the Shaolin Monastery Tibetan scripture that sweeps the floor monk, although embracing the world martial arts, not show off not reserved, no joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeper monk" , every pair of Naoko's heart, has behind it a homeland of his own.
Our nation bears the burden, not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl high school student was madly turned by netizens, "When a hero passes by, someone sits by the roadside and applauds ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting by the roadside and applauds.
In fact, when the hero and give the hero applause, there is no contradiction.

The sweeping monks have the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Scripture Pavilion, Yuan Longping has the vast rice experimental field, Nanrendong has the "Tian Eye", Qin Yi has the stage, Zhou Ruchang has the pulpit ...
For example, China's Heavenly Eye, now it seems, is a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slope, novelist Liu Tzu-shing has not yet begun to write "Three Bodies.
At that time, the bull's "eye" was the single-sided radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico, 350 metres in diameter, considered the most insurmountable in the world.
At that time, the diameter of Chinese radio telescopes was less than one tenth that of other people's.
But Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home with a near-crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio telescopes in China to receive more information from outer space.
China spends a lot of money to play with stars.
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, and the "Tianye" project kicks off with a bang.
It took 12 years to locate and 9 years to complete the project.
With the opening of the 500 - meter - caliber Skyeye, China has achieved an unprecedented "unique scientific project in the world".
Therefore, the "eye of heaven" is remarkable, Nanrendong people are remarkable, is big, stands high in the distance republic is remarkable.
With the trust of the state and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have the opportunity to become the souls of the people's liver.
There are young talented, white-haired heroes gracefully past, there are people in the roadside gently applaud, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.

Chirac's political legacy endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac passed away on Tuesday at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing an unprecedented upheaval in a century, the French politician's political heritage is still worthy of our appreciation.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a very charismatic way.
He not only inherited the diplomatic spirit of De Gaulle's independence, but also firmly supported European integration.
At the same time, he vigorously advocated the world multipolarization and multilateralism, is a strategic vision of the statesman.
For this reason, the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's delightful political decisions was to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to defy American pressure, in the forefront of the anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Later it turned out that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is at a loss and America's unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.
Chirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the Golden Decade of Sino-French Relations.After his first election to the presidency of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the cooperation between the two countries in various fields, including aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation, made breakthroughs.
The Sino-French Cultural Year, initiated by Chirac, has created a completely new mode of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong devotion to Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is understood that his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can recite some of Li Bai, Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the Chinese bronze history.
"If you don't look at the pyramids, you don't really have been to Egypt, if you don't look at the terra cotta figures, you don't really have been to China.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters, Chirac said: "Western countries have concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political status in the world.
But I have full confidence in China.
"I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it build up its concepts and values of harmonious development and shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come.
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creativity and enrich the world culture.
The emperor is gone, but the political legacy and revelations Chirac left to the world will endure.

HKSAR Legislative Council Established Members' Joint Office Against US Involvement Act
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) issued a joint statement on the 27th, the U.S. House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee passed the "Hong Kong Bill of Human Rights and Democracy" expressed strong opposition.
The statement, signed by 40 constitutional MPs, said Hong Kong's rights under the Basic Law now include maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs territory, conducting business, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions in various fields, including economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China".
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in various fields of cooperation.
The statement said there was no need for the U.S. Senate and Senate committees to pass the bill, but only in response to the call of their agents in Hong Kong, as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and for their agents to gain political leverage in Hong Kong.
Constitutional lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's fine rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the U.S. passes this bill, it will not only hurt Hong Kong and the U.S. itself, but will also make China-U.S. relations worse.
The statement said Hong Kong would unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and fulfill its obligations in real earnest.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade.
The two houses of parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week, the European Times reported.
In response, French President Jacques MacKinnon recently declared that France could not "admit everyone", but at the same time tried to "admit them properly".
Reported that Mr. Maclone tried to find a compromise on immigration matters, to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In an interview during the general debate at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Mr. Maclone said he hoped there would be a genuine 'two-pronged' approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Mr. Maclone said: "If France wishes to be properly accommodated, it cannot accommodate all".
Mr. Maclone outlined four priorities of immigration policy: the expeditious granting of asylum eligibility to refugees in need of protection; a more efficient promotion of immigration integration; the reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and the more efficient resettlement of persons illegally admitted into France who were unfit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "State Medical Assistance" (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion before.
Mr Maclone said he wanted to be able to “evaluate” the system, but not remove it, but impose restrictions on it.
Following his remarks, Le Penfa, leader of the far-right National Union, called his remarks "empty talk".
Senate Speaker Mitch Lachell, a right-wing Republican, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Mr. Maclone.
Mr Varo, a left-wing Socialist MP, said France should be "more receptive and better" to immigration and criticised Mr Maclone for "manipulating" the issue.
A year after the new asylum and immigration law was enacted, it has led to disagreements within the ruling party but failed to placate the right-wing opposition, the report said.
In the next election in 2022, immigration policy will again be the focus of attack on the far right, and Mr. Maclone will need to do something about it, but at the same time risk infuriating leftists within the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly is due to debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are on the cusp of repurchase, with many listed companies offering genuine gold and silver to buy back shares.
According to financial data service provider Orient Wealth, the total amount of A-share buybacks implemented by listed companies in Hong Kong has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, below the same level) as at 27th, far exceeding previous figures for the same period, setting an all-time high in the volume of A-share buybacks.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Mike Rong Information Consultancy Co., said the low overall valuation of the A-share market this year and the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices would help listed companies increase the efficiency of capital use, reflect the willingness of listed companies to actively manage the market value and the abundant cash flow, which would help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted the listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
Earlier this year, for example, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges issued detailed rules for the implementation of share repurchase by listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for listed companies.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented repurchase plans so far this year are mainly in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment industries.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies repurchase more than 1 billion yuan this year.

September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport launching ceremony was held.
The shape of Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal means "Phoenix spreads its wings" and is known as the first of the "seven wonders of the new world".
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, carrying 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers a year after Atlanta.
It is estimated that by 2022, Beijing Daxing International Airport will handle 45 million passengers and 20 percent of international flights, and by 2025, it will handle 72 million passengers and 30 percent of international flights.
As a'new frontier ", how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Beijing Daxing District and Guangyang District of Langfang City in Hebei Province.
Its terminal has a steel roof over the ground projection area of 180,000 square meters, the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival floors and two departure floors - F1-F4 are international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure and international departure.
The two-storey bridge connecting the highway and the airport outside the terminal building corresponds to the terminal buildings F3 and F4 respectively.
Beijing Daxing International Airport opened the era of "double airport" in Beijing.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new power source for China's development and a comprehensive transport hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, supporting the construction of the Xiong'an New Area.So far, 66 airlines are interested in joining the Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 regional airlines from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and foreign airlines.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes in the winter and spring of 2008, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international routes.
This forms a "double hub" airport pattern with coordinated development, moderate competition and first-class international competitiveness of Beijing Capital International Airport, which not only relieves the operational pressure of the capacity saturation of the capital airport, but also better meets the urgent needs of the rapid growth of air transport in and around Beijing, thus effectively enhancing the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport takes full account of its geographical location, the relationship between the airport and its surrounding airspace and operating environment.For the first time in China, the airport runway has adopted an all-directional layout, adopted the world's largest automated air traffic control system, and established China's largest terminal control area, thus maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, domestic airports have adopted the localized baggage automatic processing and information management system, and adopted the innovative baggage transfer mode to improve the efficiency of baggage processing system.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, the first flight, a harbinger of the phoenix dazzling cool take-off.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts with a localization rate of 98 percent or more, will surely have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
Vice Minister Fu Meets with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (1)
Mr. Ma tentatively scheduled a Central Committee congress in early November to revise the party's constitution and lower the party's age to 16.

Shandong Shouguang County Committee secretary Wang Boxiang - Qiangxian rich people Chizixin - Xinhua
Born in February 1943, Wang Boxiang, a Shouguang native of Shandong province, joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1967.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed secretary of Shouguang County Committee in Shandong Province, where Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five-year tenure in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: first, promoting the industrialization of vegetables; secondly, developing the salt-alkali beaches in Shouguang North; and thirdly, laying the foundation for the industrial turnaround.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but also have a lesson of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a bumper crop but could not sell it, rotting in the fields.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasp vegetables is to do a good job of circulation.
Shouguang pioneered the establishment of wholesale vegetable market, opened the prelude to the development of the market economy.
Party cadres and cadres should take the lead and break up, all losses in the county bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, set up 17 vegetable greenhouses in winter.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion team, under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi in the township tour guidance; the first year on the promotion of more than 5000 vegetable canopy, after the vegetable canopy such as prairie fire to the county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 1.6 million mu of land in addition to saline alkaline beaches, is a shallow beach paint.
The life of the local people is very hard.
Shou Nan has a vegetable canopy, Shou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to engage in a general assembly war, camped in the desolate alkaline beaches, forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the county's leading cadres eat and live in the construction site, like migrant workers carrying carts, wind meals and camping, the common people see them are thumbs-up, heartfelt admiration ... At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 mu of shrimp pools, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields, in the salt-alkali beaches on the development of a "pot.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang attended the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as a secretary of the county council.
During the meeting, a "Comparison Table of Urban Industrial Economic Figures of Twelve Countys in Weifang City" was issued.
But if the salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output is worth just 119 million yuan, ranking third to last.
Wang Boxiang, with a group of more than 70 people, went abroad to "change their minds".
Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, they organized "learn scriptures" and went to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai to learn scriptures.
Shouguang is short of enterprises, even less entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang chaired a special conference: in the county's open selection of factory director managers, 40 "business-minded talents" to stand out, was pushed to the industrial front line.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang deputy mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 greenhouses, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4,4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 "thousand-yuan households" and a rank of cadres recognized by the people.
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the African member states of China and the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Foreign Ministers of Ce d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Rio de Janeiro, South Africa, Pandor, Niger and Tunisia.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, we must unite to make a difference.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms governing international relations have been challenged, and the role of the United Nations has been undermined, thus harming the interests of the vast number of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder so that unity can be strengthened.
In the Security Council, the three African nations speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa, not just four votes, will lead other nations to follow up, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council.
Second, settle disputes by negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has successfully mediated by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly the scourges of colonialism or are directly related to external factors.
Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and play the role of the UN in good offices and mediation.
Third, self-improvement by self-determination.
African countries and peoples know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa's hotspot issues, the Council should focus on listening and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and steadfastly promote capacity-building for independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, development is fundamental to governance.
Both China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We must give top priority to economic and social development and support each other on the path of development they have chosen.
China is ready to work closely with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the UN's Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
We will work together to increase UN investment in Africa's development.
With the outbreak of Ebola in Congo (Kim), China has given and will continue to give its full support, providing human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other organizations to intensify their assistance efforts so as to play a good role in the UN Stabilization Mission in Congo (Kim).

China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007]
Reporter 27 from the Wuhan Municipal Government Press Office held a series of "Li Zan New China welcome the military games" city press conference, learned that this year, the city has accelerated the industrial intellectualized transformation, and implemented a maximum of 20 million yuan transformation subsidy measures.
Up to now, has collected more than 800 industrial enterprises above the scale of intellectualized transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy head of the Wuhan Bureau of Economics and Information Technology, said that from this year onwards, Wuhan will launch an action plan for the intellectualized transformation of industrial enterprises.
According to the plan, Wuhan openly selects a batch of specialized diagnostic service organizations each year, and conducts a demand survey on intellectualized transformation for all industrial enterprises above the scale of the city through the establishment of columns, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door reporting.
Up to now, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have been collected intellectualized transformation needs information, accounting for the city's industrial enterprises above the size of nearly one-third.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams into enterprises in batches to carry out "one-on-one" on-the-spot evaluation and program demonstration.
At present, the city is organizing and implementing 373 intellectualized transformation projects with a total investment of 29.76 billion yuan.Hongxin Communications China's first 5G intellectualized production line, Motorola's national leading intellectualized mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, aerospace science and engineering nation's first batch satellite production line, Huisheng Biological World's leading new type of intellectualized veterinary drug production line, European intelligent home Internet of Things intelligent production line and other industry-leading intelligent workshops and intelligent factories have been launched.

Trudo's man-made collapse. Will he be re-elected successfully
This time, Trudo stumbled out of the "big hole" and it was Trudo who dug it little by little.
Recently, Canadian media have revealed a series of incumbent Prime Minister Trudo's old photos, in which he disguised himself as a black image.
This was seen as an apparent act of racial discrimination and immediately caused uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, don't buy much.
Trudo lifted a stone and threw it at his feet.
As political commentators such as Leary have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black-face movement" in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have high-profilely accused the opposition or dissidents within their own party of "deficit" in this regard and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits this mistake should be dismissed immediately".
To put it simply, this time Trudo stumbled out of the "big hole" and it was Trudo himself who dug it little by little.
Trudo, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, was a handsome young man who had a whirlwind of "political idols" when he first started his career.
Formerly a political vegetarian, he took over as head of the Federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly good fight in Canada's federal legislative elections in 2015 when the Liberals won a valuable seat in the House of Commons and a separate cabinet.
At that time, Trudo had proposed a number of deafening platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the eradication of corruption and "unhealthy practices".
However, for five years in office, he has been "going high and going low" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In the case of Ethnic and Gender Equality, let alone the Black Face incident, he had been so vocal about aboriginal issues that aboriginal groups and leaders moved protest tents to the gates of Capitol Hill on Canada's 150th anniversary.
To put an end to corruption, Trudo was involved in the roaring "Lan Wan Ling" at the end of last year.
It was revealed that his hometown construction company "Lan Wanling" major violations of malpractices for personal gain, the departments and officials responsible for the investigation and punishment of pressure on the latter "high-handed".
Moreover, Trudo became angry with the disclosure officer, Wang Zhoudi, who was the first Canadian attorney general to disclose fraud cases directly.
Although the case itself is suspicious, but its suspicion is difficult to wash away.
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudo during his five years in power was largely due to his own "digging holes", the biggest of which are the "tiger-headed snake-tail" "self-eating" and "being lenient and strict with the law".
Support for Trudo has slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent since 2015, while opposition has soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent, according to the most authoritative Angus Reed poll in Canada.
Despite equally poor performance by other opposition parties and their leaders, even a significant proportion of voters who would vote for the Liberals now turn a deaf ear to the prime minister and leader of the ruling party.
On October 21st, with a new federal legislative election due to begin, will Trudo be able to repeat the winning streak of five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development of integration, are far-reaching impact and positive significance.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened to traffic.
Beijing News reporters from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission learned that the capital airport has been in a state of super-saturated operations, Daxing International Airport opened, will enhance the capital's aviation services capacity.
Following Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city with two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international air transportation.
Daxing Airport, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more positive impact.
The capital airport handled more than 100 million passengers in 2018, ranking first in the country.However, compared with the fast-growing business demand, there is still a significant capacity gap, especially in the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism and business trips, and to meet the development trend of an increasingly open and internationally connected city in Beijing, Daxing International Airport has been positioned as a major international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million and cargo throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports do not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.
On the economic accounting level, Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, easing Beijing's air capacity constraints, speeding up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput and creating an incremental cake for the capital's dual-nuclear operations.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it will not be necessary to concentrate on traveling at the Capital Airport in the future, but it will also reduce a series of problems caused by the over-concentration of routes, such as the prolonged safeguard time at the terminal, the slower boarding speed of passengers, the indirect increase of the delay time between aircraft and passengers at the airport, the aggravation of the burden on airport operations, and the reduction of the burden on passengers' travel experience through the Capital Airport.
According to media estimates on the time and cost of various transportation routes to major international airports, if you take the Beijing-Kaijing Expressway from the South Ring Road and go directly to the Daxing Airport Expressway, you can get there in 50 minutes with about 40 yuan for fuel and 15 yuan for high-speed.
Generally speaking, the public have a wide choice of transportation to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing Airport is located as a transportation hub between Beijing and Tianjin, so it is a little far away from Beijing, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, and makes it easier for more people to travel.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are perfect. Besides the new airport line from Beijing to Daxing Airport, there are many highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding area.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou via the Guangzhou-Guangdong-Shenzhen Expressway, residents from Langfang and Xiong'an New Areas around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport for convenient and efficient air services.
It can be seen that the opening of Daxing International Airport has far-reaching implications and positive significance not only in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, but also in terms of providing diversified choices for the travel of the vast number of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, promoting the further improvement of the service quality of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation industry, promoting the process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration and promoting the economic and trade development of the surrounding area of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the economics of individual accounts, but also the overall development of the big accounts.

The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of population planning and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of population planning and 2020.
In the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four topics, namely, economic development and the impact of some FTAs in 2008, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in 2008, outstanding issues in Vietnam's social culture in 2008, and forecasts and proposals for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
The consensus among delegates is that global economic growth is slowing and risks and challenges are rising in the first few months of the year.
Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund has determined that despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, with 70 per cent of the world's economies at a standstill, Vietnam's economy has achieved many encouraging results, with macroeconomic stability, effective controls on inflation and an average consumer price index (CPI) growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2008, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2008, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year.
In his forecast for Vietnam's economic trends in Hong Kong through 2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said Vietnam's economy showed a relatively high growth momentum in Hong Kong in the face of global economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic performance will remain basically stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will facilitate the development of trade, the economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese export commodities, and seek opportunities to expand new export markets so as to facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, we will keep inflation at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the past 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more to improving global economic governance and promoting global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world's second-largest economy, China has contributed more than 30 percent to world economic growth, Liu said.In particular, China's new policy of promoting the development of the country's economic and trade ties has led to deeper cooperation between local provinces and municipalities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the Territory.
He said that this year marks the beginning of 61 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.The two countries enjoy fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation will be a driving force for local economic and social development.
Siem Reap Governor De Seha highly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
The two sides look forward to continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual trust and mutual benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
He said the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap and China's provinces and municipalities have been remarkable.So far, the people of Siem Reap have become direct beneficiaries of the friendly cooperation between Cambodia and China, including the establishment of friendly relations with 28 provinces and municipalities, the landing of the major cultural and performing arts projects Angkor Smile and Angkor Dynasty, the Siem Reap-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, a special training course for Siem Reap provincial government officials, scholarships for Siem Reap students to study in China, voluntary clinics in rural areas, the construction of urban roads and public welfare projects for the rehabilitation of cataract.

Witness Digital China's Ten Years of Rising Clouds in Yunqi Town - Xinhua
If 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou, the conference has passed a full decade.
Large data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over the past decade, from a concept of “mist in the cloud” to the practice of “hanging on the cloud”.
At the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new " colleague" loaded with Aliyun artificial intelligence was recently surrounded by quality inspectors.
Its 24-hour uninterrupted, recognition speed is more than twice that of man-made, quality inspection accuracy rate is stable at more than 95%.
The camera-equipped quality inspector, who has studied more than 40,000 defective samples, is able to quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and classify defective batteries using cloud computing power, the company's director said.
The company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-assisted manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for the Implementation of Promoting Enterprises to ascend the cloud ( 2018 - 2020)," which states that by 2020, enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm for ascending the cloud will be greatly enhanced, and their proportion and application depth will be greatly enhanced.
Today, says Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for a digital economy where data is a key element.
Meanwhile, over the past decade, the scale of cloud computing industry in China has been constantly expanding.
The overall market for cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017, according to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economy development, the invisible "cloud" also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
This year's Yunqi conference, three consecutive appearances of the "urban brain" is still a cause for concern.
The city's brain has evolved from a vehicle for traffic management to a hub for urban management, and cooperative applications have expanded to 23 cities around the world, Ali said.
With camera perception, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and powerful computing power, the city's brain enables new urban management services such as "park first, pay later", "real-time perception of the number of visits" and "travel route design".
In the field of government service, cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government service by using one cloud to docking one thing and pushing the palm-to-hand operation together.
At present, Zhejiang government affairs through the cloud, has built the province's unified public data platform.
By September 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million legal entities in the province, bringing together data on 3,066 categories of 19.80 billion people.
The average number of calls and sharings between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 12 million per month.
Careful use of plastic tea bags to make tea!
A packet of plastic tea bags could release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, up from a person's annual estimate of the amount of micro-plastics a person consumes, but so far there is no evidence that consumption poses a threat to humans, according to a new Canadian study.
Researchers at the University of Margill in Canada reportedly found that by dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling water (95 degrees Celsius), they released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than a person's annual estimate of the amount of microplastics consumed.
According to a study released earlier in 2008, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount.
The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, tested four different types of commercially available plastic tea bags, opened them, washed them and dipped them in almost boiling water for five minutes before analyzing them with an electronic microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic load on previous foods".
Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands that use natural fiber to make tea bags still use plastic to seal their mouths, the report said.
Some brands have switched from paper to plastic tea bags, which the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, defined by researchers as microscopic plastics between 100 nanometers and 5 millimetres in size, mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest seas around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, the researchers first discovered plastic particles in human feces samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team placed water fleas in polluted water and found that the microplastics affected their behavior and deformed their development.
According to the World Health Organization, there is so far no evidence that consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how the plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the bags may have released large amounts of plastic particles because they came in contact with boiling water and could break down or leak poisonous substances even if the "food grade" plastics were heated above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres says climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster can erode the fruits of a generation's development.
This has been illustrated by hurricanes that have struck Baghdad, Dominica and the Bahamas so far this year.
About a quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At Monday's climate action summit, small island nations once again took the world in the right direction as they worked together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is piling up new injustices over old ones," Guterres said.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming is small, it pays the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and make the transition to renewable energy; and urged international agencies to assist small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, in obtaining funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, extreme sea level rise may occur annually in many regions, which would have occurred only once a century earlier.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become inhabitable without a significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons and examples for the world to learn from."
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.
India's economy is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, driven by demand for holiday consumption, as the financial system becomes more liquid, Finance Minister Mittal Sitaraman said Thursday.
Mr. Sitaraman made the remarks after meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitaraman did not specify what the remarks were aimed at.
Some Indian and overseas media have blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for the continued slowdown in India's economy.
Mr. Sitaraman cited falling auto sales as an example, denying that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline.
Mr. Sitaraman said the decline in auto sales was largely due to cyclical factors.
Mr. Sitaraman expects growth to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and lasts until the end of the year.
Shopping consumption is expected to boost India's economic growth significantly.

Supporting pig production and ensuring market supply
Sui Loyalty Requirements to Be Implemented in Six Aspects
A teleconference was held today to re-mobilize and re-deploy the policies and measures of the Central Committee, provincial Party committees and provincial governments to support pig production and ensure market supply.
Sui loyalty requirements, from six aspects to do a good job of pig production measures to implement.

We will do a good job in implementing various policies and measures to effectively solve the "last kilometer" problem.
We will do a good job in the production of breeding sows, earnestly implement the policy of subsidy for breeding sows, encourage breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of breeding sows, and select the best sows from the commercial pig population in a planned way.
We should do a good job of attracting investment and take the domestic well-known large-scale aquaculture enterprises which have not yet entered our province as the top priority.
We will implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for pigs, and promote the transition from "mixing pigs" to "mixing meat".
We must do a good job in implementing the modern epidemic prevention system, and all localities should be equipped with grass-roots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel suited to the scale and tasks of farming, so as to set up the first line of defense against and control of epidemic diseases.
Sui loyalty demands that all efforts be made to ensure the supply of meat products in the market, to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage, wide-scale supply disruption, and to ensure a stable supply of pork during major holidays.
The meeting also deployed measures to prevent and control swine fever in Africa, ban fishing and catching in important waters of the Yangtze River basin in our province, and purchase rice in the middle and late stages of the province.

<unk>淚t is estimated that over-aged migrant workers make up more than half of the construction sites.<unk>?
Where can I find young workers now?
There is no way the site would want to use so many'old people'.
Recently, there are many over-aged migrant workers on the construction site (over the retirement age) phenomenon, said Zou Kui, a long-time construction contractor.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities carry out rain and sewage diversion project, the campus appeared a lot of migrant workers, if you take care to observe, you will find that there are many over-aged migrant workers.
The over-aged migrant workers go out to work not because they are not idle, but because they have the helplessness and hardship of having to - whether it's saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems or helping their children - which drives the old people who should have been idle to continue to work hard.
It is not as easy as we think for the over-aged migrant workers to be supported by their old age.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing for their children's education, helping them build houses and buy cars, helping them start a family and supporting their grandchildren from generation to generation, when these migrant workers have completed their "life tasks", their purses have been emptied and even many debts remain, most of them lacking in wealth accumulation.
In order not to procrastinate their children and to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing it until they can't do it".
The reluctance of many new generations of post-80s, post-90s and even post-00s to engage in hard-pressed, high-intensity secondary or low-end service industries has created a structural labour shortage, and these unattractive jobs have provided opportunities for over-aged migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills, physical functions and labor capacity have declined.Many over-aged migrant workers are engaged in jobs of high intensity, low income, high risk and low security.
The plight of the over-aged migrant workers behind the "no idleness" cannot be ignored or ignored.
To solve the problem of wage arrears and wage-seeking, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income and improve the living conditions of over-aged migrant workers are also inseparable from their "self-saving" as well as from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that over-aged migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on farming home to solve their old-age and medical problems, they have to support their families through other means.
Understanding over-aged migrant workers "cannot idle" helplessness and strong, help us better understand over-aged migrant workers love and pain.
Seeing over-aged migrant workers behind their backs, hearing their sighs and trying to get them back to the countryside to truly live on their old age requires the sharing of responsibilities between the public sector, the market and society in a virtuous interaction.
Mr. Chemetzov said that over the next five years Russia would not export such systems because "the supply of its own troops is the first step before export production takes place".
This approach is in full conformity with international practice.
Leading producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glihov, deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's space forces, said the system would be ready to be developed.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antai" air defense Kangzeen.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems, using the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range below 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near-space.
The weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, particularly the S-400 system, which is very important from a national defense standpoint.
Sergei Chemetzov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in operation with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
The modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Territories Arctic Air Defense Corps has been completed, according to news on Sept. 15.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defence ministry says this is all part of a transition plan to more sophisticated defence tools in the northern strategic direction.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has significantly increased," the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service said.
It is important that the military assess the success of the system in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air defense regiment officers and soldiers for the new system has been trained and ready to enter the combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it is still part of the.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a wide range of air targets, be they high-speed targets flying at high altitudes or "fish in the leak" approaching protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Gold Diamond Antunes Air Defense, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometers per second within 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the Arctic to ensure airspace security by northern sea routes.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the Arctic air defence system.
Russia's defence ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Tol" forces in the future will be expanded to a complete brigade-level system.
Along with the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on New Territories Island and the Koala Peninsula, as well as the short-range Pantsir-SA systems deployed in the Arctic North, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons effectively defend Russia's polar skies.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break through.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
Russia Pindo, a Russian store operator, specializes in selling Russian goods in China.
... class='class1'>Russian products in Tiancat, Jingdong ( JD ), 1688, Pininduoduo, hand Q ( ShouQ ), multifunctional instant messaging software Weichat and other China's largest trading platforms have their own online platformspinduo.com and Russian retail chain stores.
Russia Export Center will work with Russia Pinduo to develop store marketing strategies and participate in standards and screen virtual shelf products enterprises.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of this year and shelves at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the total number of monthly visits to the platforms of Chinese electricity suppliers reached 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, exceeding $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open a global import strategy within the framework of the pilot store sales from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore goods.
The new store will display merchandise from companies with sales of at least 500 million roubles or more, according to Alexa Kozyrevnikov.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher. 500 million roubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and regard our products as high quality and green products.
'The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and is intensifying, ' he said.
"Our goal is ambitious, " he said. "Within three years, 500 businesses will be launched through this store. "
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian enterprises in the Far East products.
“This is a political project that represents the image of both sides because Russia’s export centres are state-owned rather than privately owned,” said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor of trade policy basics at Russia’s Plekhanov Economic University.
"I don't see a lot of competitive Russian goods on the market. "
He said the project is unlikely to actually be implemented, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 products of Russian companies have been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in China as well as in other countries, said Andrei Slepev, president of Russia's export centre, during the Eastern Economic Forum, according to the Russian news agency.
There is also a model for working with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, the first of which was held in July.
The Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises participating in trade exhibitions and commercial projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-metre exhibition hall, which will also be the center for business projects, agreement signing ceremony, referrals and talks with representatives of Chinese enterprises.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: "In addition to the agricultural stands, we are bound to hold business meetings, that is, to arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts aimed at supporting enterprises and ensuring that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them."
In addition, the Expo will host master classes, cooking competitions and the "Shanghai Station to Explore Russian Food" project of Russian chefs cooking Russian food tasting.
Following Friday's verdict by the Moham Abdi coroner's office that the cause of death was not accidental, police awaited a full report and instructions from the Attorney General's Office to take further action.
The National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau, Na Governor Huszl, issued a statement Friday, according to the coroner's verdict, the police will await the General Prosecutor's Office to give the most further instructions.
He stressed in the statement that the police have never ceased the investigation into the death of Moham and that the investigation is still under way.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noahzin said police would wait for a full report of the verdict before taking action.
He responded to questions Friday morning after attending a ceremony at the Xuezhou police headquarters where the deputy chief of police was transferred.
He said the police investigated the case on the basis of reports.
He added that depending on the progress of the investigation, the police would decide whether to call again those who had previously been interviewed.
Reporters from the Beijing Bureau of Landscape Greening learned that, in order to welcome the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, Beijing recently to Chang'an Street and along the main axis, comprehensively enhance the landscape of landscape greening, to create a peaceful and festive atmosphere.
At present, 12 three-dimensional flower beds along Chang'an Street have been completed, 20 million potted flowers decorated the capital, dressed up for the coming National Day.
Over the past few days, 12 colorful and varied three-dimensional flower beds along Chang'an Street have attracted many citizens to watch and take photos.
These flower beds have distinct themes, ranging from the "Great 70 Years" in the northwest corner of Jianguomen Gate to the "Beautiful Tomorrow" in the northeast corner of Fuxingmen Gate, bringing together the glorious achievements made in various fields in the 70 years since the founding of New China and showing the people's happy life.
The head of the Beijing Bureau of Landscape Greening said that this year's greening arrangements make full use of their own innovative achievements, integrating new varieties and new technologies at home and abroad.
Overall, over 230 varieties were used in flower beds, including 16 self-cultivated varieties, 18 green resistant new varieties and 11 native plants.
Three chrysanthemum varieties, namely "Cold Dew Races for Brightness" "Flowers of Autumn" and "Flowers of Autumn", which were independently bred in China, have been used for the first time.
In order to welcome the National Day, Beijing has also recently carried out comprehensive improvements to the city's landscape environment, replanting more than 12,000 trees, 230,000 shrubs and 2.3 million square meters of grass root flowers.

New China Time Review: Steadfastly Take Our Own Road
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the right path for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China follows the path of development that suits it.
Since modern times, in the environment of poverty, weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolence scholars to explore the way to save the country and save the people up and down, go on.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the Restoration, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system and the presidential system have all been thought and tried, and the results have not worked."
Only with the Communist Party of China and New China did the Chinese people gradually open up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is a path of happiness for the Chinese people, a path of rejuvenation for the Chinese nation and a path of common development for China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path conforms to China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
Looking back on the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
Chinese people know the truth of the North and South orange, understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, only suitable for their own is the best.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that attracts worldwide attention.
In the twists and turns of human progress, "the final conclusion of history" has been known for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the conclusion of history, the collapse of the theory of China's collapse and the failure of the theory of socialist failure.
China's success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries in achieving national prosperity and strength for the people, broadened the way for the developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for the countries and peoples of the world who wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence and follow the path consistent with their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
Instead of importing or exporting the Chinese model, China will unswervingly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges in governance with other countries and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
At the Fair Work Commission, the boss of a Foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old worker by text message because he preferred to hire people from Asian backgrounds, a practice fiercely criticised as “disgraceful”.
The commission said the way Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, who had worked at Wagga Wagga's for more than 20 years, treated her employees was "very unfair" and could have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the commission, conducted a search on the Internet and found "some job ads that Mr. Wang used to post on various Chinese employment forums in Australia".
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Asian woman preferred" and the other "Asian staff preferred".
The third post said he was "more inclined to overseas people" .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April, citing her absence and alleged cash shortages at cash registers ranging from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
For three years she had been absent from only one flight, and the "loss amount" amounted to several Australian dollars.
He stated that Ms. Ayton's dismissal had "actually nothing to do with her conduct or behaviour".
"It seems to me that, supported by the evidence in Mr. Wang's job advertisement, the real motive behind the defence's dismissal was that he preferred to hire staff with Asian backgrounds," he said.
Under section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct appears to constitute a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant."
Mr. Sams said that given Mr. Wang's "horrifying" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker at A$26 an hour.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour-relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his findings and documents to the commission's directors to consider whether Mr Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal, he said.
He said: "I believe that the Respondent has resorted to hopelessly unjust and biased procedures to dismiss the applicant and that Mr. Wang has 'waited' this opportunity, which he believes will 'prove' that the termination of the employment of the applicant is justified."
"He was wrong ... the respondent, in dismissing the applicant, totally ignored any natural and fair treatment accorded to her and, shockingly, his rude and grossly unjust perfunctory behaviour."
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business, "it must be frankly stated that no decent employer would fire its employees in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in the case."
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

Vice Minister Fu Meets with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (1)
Six men suspected of forging and selling Chinese passports, birth papers and identity cards, including an Assistant Director of the National Registry and a businessman with a supervisory rank, appeared before the court on Thursday.
Among them, a defence lawyer representing the Chinese-American defendant, Mr Lai Chun-wah, who was also a member of the Sunset Cave District Council, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant, i.e. to cease to be the defendant's defence lawyer.
He said he had drawn criticism from his political enemies for representing the defendant and that his party, the Action Party, was involved.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threats, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to smear the PAP and the Greek League government or other Greek League leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said there was no conflict of interest between the defendant and being a member of Congress, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants. So far, the defendant, Mr Lai, has not been convicted.
On September 12, 2006, the defendants, faced with various charges under section 26E of the Anti-Smuggling and Anti-Smuggling Immigration Ordinance and section 466 of the Criminal Code (Forgery of Documents), totally denied their guilt and were not granted bail pending trial.
Two District Judges Nosahar and Mazlan on Thursday approved the prosecution's application to hand over the six defendants' allegations under the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration laws to the High Court, pending the handover of the documents to the defence.
The six defendants were arrested under the 2012 National Security Crimes (Special Measures) Act ( SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.

China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007]
In order to stabilize the company's share price and preserve its image, listed companies have been buying back shares frequently in the past two years.By means of directed repurchase and collective bidding, the listed companies hope to send the message that the company's value is undervalued to the market, thus stabilizing the share price and enhancing investor confidence.
According to Orient Wealth Choice, listed companies spent 7.9 billion yuan on repurchase of shares in 2017, jumping to 51 billion yuan in 2018.The total amount of repurchase of A-shares by listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan since its implementation in Pig, setting an all-time high of repurchase funds for A-shares and well above previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the repurchase shares of the company and the majority shareholders seem to hold the same, but the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, repurchase use, the rights and interests of the stocks are very different.
The Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares, issued in November 2018, addressed problems existing in the current system, such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory system, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Mikerong Information Consulting Co., told the Securities Daily.
In January this year, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges formally issued the “Rules for the Implementation of Share Repurchase by Listed Companies”, which broadened the sources of funds for listed companies to repurchase shares, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership schemes.
After the publication of the opinion, the listed companies to carry out share repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, share repurchase enthusiasm is greater.
Repurchase of shares at a relatively low level also helps listed companies to increase the efficiency of capital use, thus increasing the level of earnings per share, raising the return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
The repurchase of shares of listed companies is more significant than that of major shareholders. It also shows the willingness of active market value management and abundant cash flow of listed companies.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued share price is a major factor in the repurchase of listed companies, the company's share price has been unable to reflect the future of the company's development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the earnings of such listed companies and specific operating conditions.
The large-scale repurchase behavior of listed companies, at least demonstrated the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The growing enthusiasm for buybacks by A-share listed companies has also normalized repurchase behaviour, with figures showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share buybacks this year, and industry-leading companies have become the mainstay of the repurchase market.
Ping An recently disclosed its repurchase progress, saying it had bought back 57.59 million shares of A-shares, or 0.315 percent of the company's total equity, through a centralized bidding exercise, and had paid a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), all of which would be spent on employee ownership plans, including but not limited to long-term service plans approved by the company's shareholders' meeting.
Yili shares have paid $5.792 billion for share repurchase and have recently adjusted the use of the repurchase shares from the planned “all of the repurchase shares will be used as a source of late-stage equity incentives” to “a cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million will be used as a source of late-stage equity incentives and the remaining 30.49 million will be written off to reduce registered capital”.
Yili shares said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help further raise earnings per share and effectively increase returns on investment by shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a repurchase progress announcement, TCL Group repurchase a cumulative 3.59 percent of the company's shares, total cost 1.65 billion yuan.
The repurchase will be used for employee ownership schemes, equity incentives or convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies, TCL's board office told the Securities Journal.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, constantly improve competitiveness, sustained and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the protection of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's stocks in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to repurchase the company's shares using its own funds, self-financing and other fund-raising methods.
Yang Delong, chief economist of the former Sea Open Source Fund, said the repurchase of shares by listed companies, on the one hand, could reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market and increase earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important advantage for secondary market shares; on the other hand, the willingness of listed companies to take out genuine gold and silver from the stock market repurchase of shares write-off, which greatly boosted confidence in the market.
In recent years, the repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased, especially the outstanding shares. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through the repurchase of shares, and it is also worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, the four main leaders of the Hunan army in the construction machinery manufacturing sector, set a "small goal" to build a world-leading cluster of construction machinery industries in the next 35 years.
To build the world's leading industrial cluster of construction machinery in Changsha, in the current fashion, is to create "the strongest surface" .
As the capital city of the inland province, Changsha shouted this bravado.
Depending on the strength of the bully side leak.
The four Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue are well-versed in the fields of sky, underground, sea and land: Shanhe intelligent light aircraft, the concrete conveying pump of Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Trinity Heavy Industries' all-ground crane, and Iron Construction Heavy Industries' tunnel shield machine.
Once upon a time, China had little say in construction machinery manufacturing.
Time flies, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go out" two-wheel drive, take advantage of the east wind of the initiative, take over, merge, set up factories and other measures simultaneously, a leap to become the world's leading construction machinery industry.
Among them, Trinity Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Railway Construction Heavy Industries, Shanhe Intelligent Construction Machinery and other leading enterprises, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
It's the camera that controls the momentum.
The "Four Great Diamonds" of the Xiang Army of Construction Machinery is the leader of the Changsha Construction Machinery Industry Cluster and the head enterprise of the construction machinery industry in the world.
In the world of industry, who can live, and live well, is the hard line.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry encountered a cold winter, many well-known international construction machinery manufacturers have collapsed, but the construction machinery manufacturers in Changsha "cat winter" as a "winter swimming", self-imposed pressure, self-breakthrough, through the industrial restructuring, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only survived, but also strengthened the body and bones.
Relying on the stars of the moon of the government and enterprises to help.
The development of dominant industries not only requires enterprises to be aggressive, but also requires the government to act actively.
The reason why Changsha enjoys the reputation of being the capital of construction machinery lies in the fact that it has gathered the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, created many clusters of related industries, and greatly reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving the supporting services and simplifying the examination and approval procedures.
Good business ecology, so that construction machinery manufacturers poured in.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of construction machinery, time and tide wait for no man.
Both the government and enterprises, as well as the relevant producers and researchers, should seize the opportunity, keep up with the times, set goals and make sustained efforts to contribute Hunan's strength to the building of a manufacturing power.

France's finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow up
LONDON (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revitalize its sluggish economy, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemaire said the ECB's latest monetary easing creates an opportunity for more investment by governments of able member states.
The ECB cut interest rates to record lows on Sept. 12 and plans to restart debt purchases to drive down borrowing costs in an effort to stimulate recovery and inflation.
"Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Mr Lemaire told reporters.

He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already introduced more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, giving it a big boost.
With the global economy losing momentum, Germany's export-dependent economy bears the brunt.
Lemel said the tax burden on French households would be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax breaks.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros over a five-year period as corporate tax rates gradually fall from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent.

Study: US National Healthy Eating Index Rises slightly but Still Challenges
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government's diet index has risen modestly in 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new study.
But with a full score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diets.
Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutritional researcher at the University of Tafts in Massachusetts and co-author of the study, said Americans still eat too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes and obesity, the most common diseases among Americans.
The study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Thursday.
The study was based on a government health survey of 44, 000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write that "significant dietary challenges persist despite significant improvements".
The challenges include cutting back on saturated fats such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle and butter.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended 10 percent limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but still too high.
Officials say adding sugar to your diet should be less than 10%.
But Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to foods that aren't even sweet enough, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adult intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains increased slightly in the United States.
However, 2016 figures show that these foods still make up less than 5 percent of the diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and low-quality carbohydrate intake from fruit juice consumption, Zhang says they still account for as much as 42 percent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on a biennial personal health survey that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
A government-issued dietary guide for Americans recommends adopting a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should eat more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and protein-rich seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seeds.
During the study, the number of Americans with diabetes almost doubled, more than 7 percent, and the obesity rate increased over the years - now about 70 percent of American adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains a major cause of death among Americans.

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) (Xinhua) (Zhang Weiming Xu Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day and night work, the construction of the No.1 shaft of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel at Jianda (Li) Railway was completed on Sept. 27, reaching a depth of 762.59 meters below the ground.
Located in Yunnan Province, the 34.5 km-long Grand Swiss Railway tunnel runs through the Gaoligong Mountains from the Angry Jiangxi River and is the longest single tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel passes through 19 fault zones, with a maximum burial depth of 1155 metres, and is known as the "Geological Museum" of the tunnel because it covers almost all the hazardous geology and significant risks that may be encountered in the construction of the tunnel.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel in Gaoligongshan Tunnel. It shoulders the important tasks of increasing the working surface to realize the "long tunnel and short tunnel" and the ventilation in the later stage of railway operation.
The successful excavation of No.1 shaft to the bottom of the tunnel marks the formal entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel.After the excavation of the underground vehicle yard and the replacement of equipment, four additional working faces will be added under the tunnel to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The shafts are all in granite formations, because there are so many cracks in the granite formations that the water cannot be stopped.
Zhao Jing, chief engineer of the project department of Darui Railway, told reporters that the construction of the shaft, many times occurred mud inrush water, collapse and other dangerous situations, the construction party invited experts to the scene, more than 20 discussions on the treatment plan.
"The maximum inrush in the shaft is 300 cubic meters per hour, 700 meters deep at the bottom of the shaft, and the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep at the bottom of the sea."
"If we don't pump and drain in time, we'll flood wells 10 meters in an hour," he said. "We spend almost 85 percent of our time treating water and 15 percent of our time digging.
In order to overcome the geological problems such as longitudinal joint development, mud inrush and water-rich granite in the perimeter of No.1 shaft, systematic water control measures combining exploration, injection and excavation were adopted to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of No.1 shaft has formed a mechanized assembly line of excavation system, ballast discharge system, suspension system and winch lifting system.
Finally, after more than 1200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the 762. 59 meters deep excavation.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, the Darui railway is an important part of the international corridor between China and Myanmar and an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the <unk>済lobal development<unk>?
Upon completion and opening, the driving time between Dali and Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promote economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate degrees on the strength of their college entrance examination results
Starting in 2020, senior high school graduates in China will be able to apply directly to German universities for undergraduate degrees based on their college entrance examination results without having to register at their home universities, according to the official website of Germany's Anabin database, which evaluates and certifies foreign academic qualifications.
Previously, Chinese senior high school graduates who wanted to apply to German universities had to study for one semester (11,985 universities) or three semesters (general undergraduate) in China and have passed the APS examination or the TestAS.
The new rules may save at least half a year for Chinese students who wish to study in Germany.

Military "robot dogs" take acting lessons The Sun Theater: Consider joining the cast.
U.S. military - funded robotic dogs for the battlefield, may now be the first to the circus stage!
The Sun Circus said yesterday it was in talks with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of using them in circus performances.
A four-legged robot, known as Spot, can carry up to 14 kilograms of weight and is highly adaptable to off-road terrain, with 360-degree obstacle-avoidance, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically developed for Spot, which allows users to set up their own robotic capabilities through a variety of applications.
The idea of a robotic dog, first unveiled in 1992 by Boston Power Technologies, caused a stir, but has yet to be put into commercial use.
However, Boston-based Power Technologies noted that Spot is now in mass production, with subscribers mostly from the construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Sun Circus is in talks with Boston Power Technologies Inc. The company says the project is still in its infancy and is evaluating the potential of Spot for use in performances.

However, after the meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Ma Hua seat should continue to be transferred to Ma Hua or replaced by other member parties.
Speaking to the media after hosting a meeting of the Ma Hua Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Wei said any by-election would be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs), which require a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front before a decision can be made.
He said the Supreme Council of the FRODEBU is scheduled to meet in early October because the Election Commission will not meet until Monday (Monday) to finalize the by-election for the Dundee seat.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Na Governor Sri Amuzahi, and we all agreed on the need to recapture this seat from the League of Hope.
"We are scheduled to hold a special meeting of FRODEBU leaders in early October, and the heads of the three parties of the FRODEBU will determine which member party will take part.
Asked whether Mr Ma would insist on taking the traditional seat in the Supreme Council of the FRODEBU, Mr Wei reiterated that, as President of the FRODEBU, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must be made in accordance with the consensus of the FRODEBU.
"In any by-election, it is not uncommon for people to be willing to go, for political parties, for some to think they should go."
"Most importantly, what organizations and political alliances do we come from?
"This is a great test of the political alliance we have formed over the years, and we believe that along the way the FRODEBU has held some valuable values.
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process, " he said.
"But once the Supreme Council of the FRODEBU has made a decision, all must be prepared for war, and that is the most valuable thing. "

For every virtual tree the user creates, Ant Forest and its public-interest partners plant a real tree in desertified areas.
By August this year, 500 million ants forest users had cut carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons, and 122 million trees had been planted in desertified areas.
Costa Rica's President Carlos Alwaleedo, who came to receive the Earth Guardian Award for his country's environmental efforts, praised the ant forest's contribution, saying it was "impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green action".
Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ant King Service, said the Earth Guardian Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Mr Yasui said the ant forest had affected 500m people over the past three years and that the goal of the forest over the next three years was to involve 1bn people worldwide in low-carbon operations.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to make farmers' income more from the green hills and rivers.
Besides providing employment opportunities by planting trees, it also hopes to help farmers to increase their income through agricultural development projects and electricity generation platforms.
"An ant forest" to create a digital technology-based model of public welfare and environmental protection has also been successfully sea, by other countries to learn from.
In June, GCash, the Philippines' largest electronic wallet, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon lifestyle.
GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental groups to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within the first year of the project, the spokesman said.
The Earth Guardian Award, the highest award in the UN's environmental field, is awarded annually.
The Ant Forest Award is the third year in a row that a green innovation project from China has been awarded an incentive and action prize, following China's Saihanba Forest Farmer and China's Zhejiang Province's Qiancun Demonstration and Wancun Remediation Project.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy.
US gross domestic product growth slowed markedly from the previous quarter as private sector investment and exports fell sharply, according to the US economic report for the second quarter.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, the final revised figures released by the US Department of Commerce showed on Tuesday.
Figures show consumption growth was the main driver of US growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, accounting for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 percent in the quarter, boosting growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption spending and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging growth of 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter and net exports dragged growth of 0.68 percentage points.
Private-sector investment has fallen sharply instead of sustaining last year's growth, as rising economic and trade frictions and uncertainty have hit business confidence, said Barry Knopf, managing partner at Enside Macroeconomics.
Under the influence of policy uncertainty, the US corporate capital expenditure is still expected to be in a downward trend next year.
Analysts say that while consumption growth provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they create have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected U.S. consumer prospects.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers voluntarily mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest percentage in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
Analysts generally believe the U. S. economy will continue to slow in the future.
But experts say the performance of the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions ease.
Karen Burch, global economist at the British Economist think-tank, predicts the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend this year, with growth slowing to even lower levels than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analysts, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year and further to 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic and trade frictions do not escalate.
'The biggest concern for companies right now is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they create,' said Ellen Harzen, investment manager at Patnam Investments. 'If the disputes are resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the industry will perform much better.
Matt Merry, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said trade and economic frictions remained a "first priority" and a major cause of the volatility in U.S. capital markets this year, and whether they can be properly resolved will be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off a year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is the embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelveth National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a large vote.
This is Ningxia's first provincial-level comprehensive and systematic local regulation to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will come into force on November 1st, 2006.
It is understood that the Regulations were revised on the basis of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women" adopted in Ningxia in 2007.The Regulations are divided into 9,65 sections, including general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and supplementary provisions.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which is the first in China.
In April this year, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guidance Notes on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children under Three Years of Age.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has put forward an innovative proposal: "Encouraging the employing units to give each husband and wife 10 days of joint parental leave each year during the period between the ages of zero and three to husband and wife who have children in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the compilation of personality rights in China's current civil code, and details the constitutional requirements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance prohibits the occurrence of sexually assaulted girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, thus becoming a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
In view of women's right to know and dispose of the common property of marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know and the obligations of property registration agencies and related bodies, thus providing a solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
In addition, in response to the social hotspot, gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination.
In recent years, Ningxia Women's Federation (WWF) has made remarkable achievements in promoting and bringing in social professionals to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and anti-domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.A number of laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Academician Yuan Longping Working Station of Inner Mongolia Xing'an League Saline-tolerant Alkali-tolerant Rice
Reporter 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xing'an Alliance Executive Office learned that the League recently held the "Xing'an Alliance Academician Yuan Longping workstation saline-tolerant alkaline rice on-the-spot yield measurement and acceptance council," good news, saline-tolerant alkaline rice average yield per mu of rice over 1000 jin.
A team of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs took samples and harvested the rice.
The average yield of saline-tolerant alkaline rice per mu reached 508.8 kg on land with pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity of 5 per thousand to 6 per thousand.
Wang Shigang, executive director of Academician Yuan Longping's workstation of UNITA, said: "Our next step is to make innovations and reforms on the basis of this year's experiments, and to re-cultivate and optimize the saline-alkali-tolerant rice varieties so as to achieve better quality and higher yields."
"On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that saline-alkali-tolerant rice will continue to perform miracles on saline-alkali soil," said Lai Yongcai, deputy dean and researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Xing'an alliance belongs to the southern foothills of Daxing'an Mountains concentrated patches of especially hard-pressed areas.
In October 2018, Academician Yuan Longping's work station was unveiled by UNITA.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the newly cultivated saline-alkali-tolerant hybrid rice varieties and advanced technologies, and set up a 960-acre saline-alkali-tolerant rice base in the right-wing flag of Horqin.
The field yield measurement of saline-alkali-tolerant rice not only provides hope for the upgrading of the saline-alkali medium-low-yield fields to medium-high-yield fields, but also provides scientific basis for the cultivation of saline-alkali rice under the same conditions in China.
After a marathon debate and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed an abortion law on Sept. 26, local time, the Australian Web site reported.
The bill is understood to have sparked political debate in the past eight weeks and has sparked serious divisions within the Australian Liberal Party since Independent Senator John Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, Australia's Senate on Tuesday night approved legislation legalizing abortion by 26 votes to 14, making it the third-longest-running bill in the state's Senate.
A final vote in the New State House of Representatives on Monday morning legalized abortion in the state.
The law allows women to terminate pregnancy at 22 weeks of conception and, if two doctors agree, abortion later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on Tuesday night that would allow doctors to consult a multidisciplinary panel of hospital advisory committees before performing an abortion for a woman 22 weeks after conception.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, the new governor faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill and repeatedly stepped in to gain more time for debate, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to spend time running the whole new state, " she pleaded in her absence.
Australia's Liberal MP, David Davis, is understood to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatening to withdraw from the new state government and calling it a "government crisis".
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: "The 26th morning to the House of Representatives amendments to the legalization of abortion legislation, in fact, for women, doctors to provide more protection."
Meanwhile, the leader of Australia's New State National Party, Barry Laro, says he is proud to be part of a government that legalizes abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, it legalizes abortion, abortion is no longer a crime, and abortion women are not treated as criminals.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 state-owned enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan to enrich social security funds.
So far, 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have completed transferring some of their state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, bringing the total amount of transferred state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Thursday.
Liu Kun made the remarks at a meeting jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security and the SASAC on the same day.
"The transfer of some of the state-owned capital to enrich social security funds is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full expression of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system.
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Programme for Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds", which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to conduct pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the early stage of the transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of transfers of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been completed, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about $860.1 billion.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions performing the functions of investors by the Ministry of Finance has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with state-owned capital transferring 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out the preparatory work in advance of the transfer, laying the foundation for the implementation of the next transfer.
According to a notice issued jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds by the central and local governments will be fully deferred in 2008, and will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting convened on that day made specific arrangements for the overall deferral of transfers.
It was emphasized that the transfer work should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Time is tight and tasks heavy.
Liu said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and make arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed according to the requirements; push forward the work in a solid manner and grasp the contents of the transfer policy accurately; and strengthen communication and coordination so as to solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
Transfer of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund Starting with Enriching Social Security Fund Moneybags, the goal is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, I believe that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but the opening of "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Society, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice Concerning the Comprehensive Pushing Out of the Work of Transferring Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund.
After the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 percent of its stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, with a total transfer value of more than 115 billion yuan.
According to regulations, social security funds and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the rights of income, disposal and knowledge of the state-owned shares.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China said in the announcement that the changes in equity will not lead to changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author thinks that the similar transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations".
The first step of transferring some state-owned enterprises to social security is the "additional result", which naturally reflects that state-owned enterprises are owned by the whole people and the fruits of development are shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, the state-owned enterprises, especially the central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy.
Among them, the leading enterprises are the continuous realization of do better and do bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided to push aside the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated that it would work with relevant departments, in accordance with the arrangements made at the executive meeting of the State Council, to push aside the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds in an all-round way so as to fully reflect the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system and the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises for the whole people.
The second step of the transition is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are facing pressure.This time, most of the state-owned funds transferred have the capability of sustained profits and dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide the source of living water for the social security funds.
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the deposit ratio of basic old-age insurance for enterprises can be reduced by one percentage point.
The third step in the rotation, the "additional result", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
This transfer of the main body to obtain income is "dividend-based, as an auxiliary" .
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, do take equity dividends as the main income.
However, social security funds, as value investors in the capital market, have a strong capability of capital operation.
As for listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which is conducive to raising the operating level of enterprises and has a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, social security funds as investment vane, the enhancement of equity holdings, conducive to further strengthening its market influence, and play a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is conducive to giving full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guiding rational investment and value investment.

The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper said that as China's overall national strength and international influence grow rapidly, there are international fears that China will follow the path of "power and hegemony," and some have raised the so-called "China Threat Theory".
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances resulting from the decline of power, and deliberate distortions of self-serving interests.

The white paper stressed that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for world economic development.

Twitter thematic labels and social media are advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today, peacefully appealing to President Susie to step down.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Disapproval has virtually disappeared in Egypt since then-military leader Hoshysei seized power in a military coup in 2013 and any form of protest is in grave danger.
The British newspaper The Guardian reports that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based non-governmental organization, says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests demanding Mr Sessi's resignation.
Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday after allegations of corruption surrounding Mr. Cecil and his family's lavish pursuit of vanity.
Egypt's Interior Ministry yesterday insisted that any attempt to destabilize the country would be resolute and not soft-handed.
Riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police lined the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces on the 25th detention of a number of important scholars and social sages, including Cairo University political science professor, well-known columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cecil will bring disaster, " he wrote on Thursday.
It is in Egypt's interest that he should step down immediately.
Before his arrest, Hosni, a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to run for the presidency with Cecil.
Constitutional Party Chairman Saddam Hussein has also been detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that the sweeping of dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of government at a time when the economic plight of the poor and middle classes is intensifying.
"The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears, " said opposition leader Ayman Nour, who was running for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been ruined by him and political repression is widespread, Cecil is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who may be replaced."
Noll pointed out that in the socio-economic situation continued to deteriorate in the premise, the government's high-handed tactics will only increase people's anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been breached, he expects more people to take to the streets.
The exiled Spanish businessman and actor Ali, a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began posting a series of films earlier this month claiming to have benefited from government corruption, triggering a wave of small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Mr. Ali says his company, Amrak, gets lucrative contracts without having to go through a legal tendering process, stressing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply saddened by his involvement.
Ali claimed that he helped Sessigue's magnificent palaces and luxury hotels, in sharp contrast to the current Egyptian life of abject poverty, and the other side has not yet paid.
Twitter has attracted tens of thousands of tweets and replies calling for people to take to the streets peacefully to demand Mr. Cecil's resignation, with themes such as "Get out of here and you're not alone", "Sassi you're dead", "Sassi get out of here" and "Next Friday".
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly seven million Twitter followers.
Yesterday, in an Arabic message, he said: "Sessi is doomed ... he is done, and his supporters are now making a big mistake."

Chen Mingzhang, dean of the Taipei Institute of Management, said the US-China trade frictions continued and Taiwanese businessmen faced an “uncertain age”.
He said Taiwanese businessmen need to keep pace with the times and keep abreast of the mainland's mainstream industries, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese traders valued quality, effectiveness and delivery.
Chen Mingzhang believes that Taiwanese businessmen only the above-mentioned conditions are not enough at present.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extending service and life product services.
In addition, "value-added services" is a new area for Taiwanese businessmen to develop vigorously.
Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Hui Wentang, Chairman of Guangdong-based Taiwanese electronics company Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd., said that Yayi Electronics had been experiencing operational difficulties as a result of the drastic reduction in orders.

New regulation to solicit opinions: social capital to obtain rural land management rights need to be qualified
Social Capital Must Be Qualified to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
"Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" to solicit opinions publicly It is proposed to supervise the transfer of industrial and commercial enterprises and other social capital to obtain land management rights
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas issued a notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (draft amendments) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Opinions), increasing the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to obtain land management rights.
The draft ideas are now open to the public for comments.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas said that in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of separation of three powers, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas has revised the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of the Right to Contracted Management of Rural Land and formed the Draft Opinions.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters understand that the first publication of the "Draft of Opinions" a number of important amendments.
The newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting clearly defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of separation of three powers, and sets up "the right to contract and manage land" and "the right to manage land" respectively in special sections, making a clear distinction between the transfer and exchange of the right to contract and manage land and the transfer of the right to manage land (lease, subcontract, shareholding or other forms).
In order to implement the concept of separation of three powers, effectively respond to the main thrust of the revision of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and take into account the differences between the transfer of land management rights and the transfer of land contracting management rights in terms of parties, procedures and supervision, the revised draft defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, including leasing and equity participation, and changes the name of the regulation from “Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting Management Rights” to “Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights”.
The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights will be regulated separately.
The draft opinion pointed out that in the "three powers separation" background, farmers shares only a certain period of land management rights.
Theoretically speaking, even if the bankruptcy liquidation occurs, the farmers only have the risk of losing the management right for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is legally unnecessary for the contracted land to be returned to the original contractor.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing land, the methods of preferred shares, leasing first and buying back shares have been developed in practice.
Considering that preferred shares have been discussed maturely in the company law, it is suggested that preferred shares should be taken as an advocacy provision to guard against the risk of loss of shares.
