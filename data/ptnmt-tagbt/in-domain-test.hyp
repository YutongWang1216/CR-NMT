Iran has accelerated its uranium enrichment with advanced centrifuges, further violating the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
The IAEA report stated that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium," according to IAEA reports.
Iran is gradually violating the limits of the nuclear deal reached with major powers in 2015 after President Trump pulled out of the deal last May and imposed sanctions on the country.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation IR-1 centrifuge to extract uranium.
Other signatories to the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have tried to salvage it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Makoto held talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in New York on Tuesday afternoon, confirming that the two sides would press ahead with negotiations on a peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the four North Islands (the disputed islands between Japan and Russia, known as the "North Islands" and Russia's "South Kuril Islands") and develop bilateral ties in a wide range of political and economic fields.
It was Mauki's first consultations with Russia since taking office as head of the peace treaty negotiations.
"While encompassing the promotion of joint economic activities [on the four northern islands]," Mauki told the Russian side, he hoped to start practical consultations.

"Hopefully, it will be successful and lead to the next step, " Mauki said in anticipation of the pilot operation scheduled for October.

Women's volleyball is expected to defend its World Cup title early!
27 against the Dutch women's volleyball matches, China's team in the two-game winning situation by their opponents back to a city, finally to the Netherlands 3-1, welcomed nine-game winning streak.
The World Cup has come to a close, although the title is in sight, but against Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team is still not to be taken lightly.
The first two sets against the Netherlands, China's women's volleyball performance as always strong, respectively with 25:19, 25:16 first down two cities, until the third set, the team encountered setbacks.
Dutch women's volleyball in the backward situation to strengthen the offensive serve, the Chinese team a pass was impacted, plus the girls attack eagerly, errors began to increase, and eventually by 21:25 opponents back to a city.
Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview after the game: "The third set, because of mistakes, we sent about 8 points. "
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball is not to be underestimated, China's women's volleyball before the difficult preparations, although lost a set, but all still in the master Lang Ping, " and the strong team win or lose the game is normal, playing five sets is normal, so we said to the team to focus, " Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the status, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the fire, single-game scored 8 points, for the team to win a big victory.
So far, 11 rounds of confrontation so far only two, China's women's volleyball team although a hand has touched the championship trophy, but the game against the Netherlands did give China's women's volleyball team to ring the alarm bells: the more critical moment, the more to concentrate on.
The U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents in a five-set match between Russia and the U.S. Women's Volleyball Team.
All kinds of circumstances are developing in favor of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although Serbia's absence of all six major players does not mean they will give the three points to China easily.
The current form of the table suggests that Serbia have little chance of winning a medal, meaning they can "lighten up" against a Chinese team that is under pressure to put all its weight behind them.
In addition, the Serbian team is not "anyone to cut" the lambs, and the previous game with the Dutch team, the two sides battled 5 sets, the Serbian team finally 3:2 reversed the Dutch main lineup, thus its thickness of the depth of the lineup.
Before the start of the third stage, Lang Ping also said that neither the Dutch nor the Serbian teams could cope well: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult.
Now that the trumpet has sounded, the game has really entered the "white-hot stage. "
On the strength of the lineup, China's women's volleyball team are above their opponents, only the final crunch, but also to see if the women's volleyball girls can play at a normal level, in the field to release themselves.

... span class='class1'>Republic will usher in the 70th anniversary of the celebration, the media spotlight suddenly lit up, so many ordinary we do not remember the image, shining - it is they, for our shining days, wisps of heat, bring light source ...
However, if the hero walks alongside, also seems ordinary as you as I.
Yuan Longping, devoted to the study of rice, has cultivated good seeds all over the world, so that more than a billion people in China will no longer be afraid of famine, and he has made great achievements. He is usually like an old peasant who likes to stroll around in the fields
They live simply, simply and persistently. So long as they immerse themselves in a cause that is difficult for outsiders to understand, but which they cherish dearly, they are easily cheerful.
Like Jin Yong's novels, the Shaolin Tibetan Sutra Pavilion that sweeping monk, although embracing world-shattering martial arts, not show off, no joy no sorrow.
Every "sweeper monk" , every pair of naked hearts, behind the scenes have a who gave me home to bear.
The responsibility of the nation lies not only in the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of millions of people.
... class='class1'>Once, a schoolgirl's words, by netizens crazy turn, "When the hero passes, there will always be someone sitting on the roadside applaud ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be sitting on the roadside applaud ...
Actually, it's not a contradiction between being a hero and giving a hero a clap.
Roadside applause, also pass heat and light, they are also luminous body.
Ordinary as you like me, life always has some opportunities, some moments, there is a cumulative, but also in the shape of a hero.
Zou Bihua, an outstanding judge in Shanghai, shoulders the responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting of the old master of the delivery room on stage to tell his story, a year received and sent numerous newspaper letters, from no mistake, "Do simple things well, is not simple", Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the "sweeper monk"-style old receive and send.
It's a little pat on the back between heroes. One hero applauds the other.
Sweeper monks have the Sacred Scripture Pavilion in Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice field, Nan Rendong has the Eye of Heaven, Qin Yi has the stage, and Zhou Ruchang has the pulpit Whether a hero can be made depends not only on one's own efforts, but also on a good environment and a positive motivation mechanism.
For example, the "Chinese Eye" , as it stands today, is a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community is still struggling to climb the slope, the novelist Liu Cixin has not yet written "Three Body" .
At that time, the ox's "eye" was the single-faced radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico, the United States - Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, is considered the "insurmountable" most in the world.
At that time, Chinese radio telescopes were less than one-tenth the diameter of others.
But Nan, who enjoys world - class scientific research and a salary, insists on returning home with the near - mad idea of building a new generation of radio telescopes in China to receive more information from outer space.
China's waste to be rejuvenated ah, investing a huge amount of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nanrendong, and the "sky-eye" project was launched.
It took 12 years to select the site and another nine years to complete the project.
With the opening of the 500-meter-diameter Eye of Heaven, China has achieved, without precedent, "the world's only major scientific project".
Therefore, the "eye of heaven" is great, Nanrendong people are great, is big, stands far from the republic is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have a chance to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
There are young heroes, gray-haired heroes walked amiably, there are people in the roadside gently applauded, such a beautiful country, very harmonious.

Chirac dies, political legacy endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac has died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing a century of unprecedented upheaval, the French statesman still deserves our praise for his political legacy.
Chirac served as president of France for 12 years in a charismatic manner.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Charles de Gaulle and firmly supported European integration. He is the representative of pursuing the "European dream" .
At the same time, he is also a strong advocate of the world multi-polarization and multilateralism, a strategic vision of the statesman.
For this reason, the French media described him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Mr Chirac's most enjoyable political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined hands with Germany to resist the pressure of the United States, in the forefront of anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Later facts proved that Chirac's warning was quite correct.
At a time when European integration is at a standstill and U.S. unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and gracious to the Chinese.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China-France relations.When he was first elected president of France in 1995, he pushed forward the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges have entered a new stage.
During Chirac's presidency, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthroughs in cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation.
The Sino-French Cultural Year initiated by Chirac has created a completely new pattern of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong love of Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac was able to memorize poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately date Chinese bronzes.
"You can't really get to Egypt without looking at the pyramids, and you can't really get to China without looking at the terra cotta warriors" -- this golden phrase comes from Chirac.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political status in the international arena.
But I personally have confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it build its concepts and values for harmonious development and long-term responsibility on the world stage.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich it.
The Greeks are gone, but Chirac's political legacy and message will live on.

Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council Members Joint Group Against US-related Bill
Some members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) issued a joint statement on Tuesday, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy 2019" by the Foreign Affairs Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
The statement, issued by a coalition of 40 constitutional MPs, said Hong Kong's current rights under the Basic Law included maintaining its status as a free trade port and a separate customs territory, concluding and enforcing bilateral and multilateral agreements in the name of "Hong Kong, China" on trade, economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, as well as on business, cooperation and development with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always adhered strictly to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics. It has engaged in a wide range of cooperation with different countries and regions and achieved remarkable results.
The statement said the Senate and Senate foreign affairs committees' move to pass the bill was unnecessary and in response to the calls of their Hong Kong surrogates to intervene roughly in Hong Kong's internal affairs and to gain political leverage for their surrogates in Hong Kong.
Establishment lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's good rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, besides hitting Hong Kong and the interests of the United States itself, it will also make the Sino-U.S. relations worse, without any benefits, harmful to others and harmful to themselves.
The statement said Hong Kong would, as always, unswervingly implement the principle of “one country, two systems” and continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations in real earnest.
Whether in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international business.
Both houses of France's parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported.
In response, French President Jean-Bertrand Macron recently claimed that France could not "accept everyone" but at the same time tried to "accept them properly".
According to the report, Makelon tried to find a compromise on immigration issues, slowing the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview on the sidelines of the General Assembly's general debate in New York, Duterte said he wanted a genuine two-pronged approach to immigration policy, striking a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Makelon said: "If France wants to be able to take [migrants] in properly, it cannot take everyone".
Marcillon listed four priorities for immigration policy: the expeditious granting of asylum eligibility to refugees in need of protection; a more efficient integration process; the reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and a more efficient resettlement of persons who had entered France illegally and were unfit to remain.
The issue of whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Aid (AME) system has been the subject of much discussion.
Mr Makron said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but would not eliminate it but limit it.
Following his remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National League, tweeted that Mr. Makelon's statement was "empty talk. "
Senate President John Ruschel, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also indirectly criticized Mr Macroen, saying immigration policy should be discussed in a "softened" but "confronted" way.
Leftist Socialist MEP François Varoufakis said France should be "more receptive and better" on immigration and criticised Mr Maclean for "manipulating" the issue.
A year after it was enacted, the new Asylum and Immigration Act has divided opinion in the ruling party while failing to reassure the right-wing opposition, the report said.
Immigration policy will once again be the focus of far-right attacks at the next election in 2022, and Mr Makron needs to do something about it, but risks angering the left of the ruling party.
France's lower house of the National Assembly will debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2, according to reports.
There are signs that China's A-shares are in the midst of a buy-back wave, with many listed companies offering genuine gold and silver to buy back shares.
According to financial data servicer Orient Wealth, the total amount of A-share repurchase by listed companies in 2019 had exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same as below), far exceeding the previous figures and setting a new record for the amount of A-share repurchase funds.
In response, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said the overall valuation of A-shares was low this year. Buying back shares at relatively low prices would help the listed companies to use their capital more efficiently.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted the listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for the implementation of share repurchase by listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for share repurchase by listed companies.
According to media statistics, listed companies that have implemented buyback programs this year are mainly concentrated in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing industries.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Topping the list was Eli shares, which were bought back for more than $5bn.
What effect will the share repurchase of listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Finance at Renmin University of China, told the China News Agency that the buyback shows that the listed company has a stronger economy and a better financial position, and is capable of maintaining stock price stability and giving investors confidence, while it also shows that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, to the market and to investors for their accountability.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For the capital markets, this is the most core of the basic elements.
The share repurchase of listed companies is helpful to boost investors'confidence and support the stock price of listed companies.
According to calculations by Oriental Securities Research Journal, based on the estimated number of A-share repurchases made by the listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average transaction price of the repurchased shares, the incremental funds brought by A-share repurchases are expected to surpass 150 billion yuan this year.

Wang Boxiang, secretary of Shouguang county committee, Shandong Province
Wang Boxiang, a native of Shouguang, Shandong Province, was born in February 1943.He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1967 and held positions of Party secretary in townships, county committees and mayors.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was the secretary of Shouguang county committee in Shandong Province, where Shouguang was the poor county of Weifang.
During his five years in office, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing the salt flats in Shoubei; and laying the groundwork for industrial renovation, thus allowing Shouguang people to bulge up their pockets and straighten their backs.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but they have also learned the lessons of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers planted a bumper harvest but could not sell it, rotting in the soil.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to grasp vegetables is to do a good circulation.
Shouguang was the first to build a wholesale vegetable market, opening the prelude to the development of market economy.
Party cadres should take the lead, if they mess up, the county will bear all the losses.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuanzhu Village, set up 17 vegetable sheds in winter heating style.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, mobilized by Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi in each township tour guide; the first year on the promotion of more than 5,000 vegetable sheds, vegetable sheds such as the momentum to the county and the whole country.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 160 million acres of land in addition to salt-alkali beaches, is the shallow beaches painted.
The local people live a hard life.
Shou Nan has vegetable shed, Shou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to conduct a general war, camped on the beach, a dry is forty-five days.
At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields and a "pool of treasures" on the salt-alkali beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference as the secretary of the county committee for the first time.
During the meeting, a "Comparison table of industrial economic figures in the twelve counties of Weifang City" was issued. At first glance, the total industrial output value of Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value remains only 119 million yuan, ranked in the bottom three.
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people to take the Sutra regiment, ran to the field "for brain. "
Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, "Lesson-taking Missions" were organized to visit places such as Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang is short of enterprises and even less of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a conference slate: in the county open selection factory managers, 40 "career-minded capable people" stand out, was pushed onto the industrial front.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the nation's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang deputy mayor.
He left behind him more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 "ten thousand yuan" households and cadres recognized by the people.
On September 26, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over a meeting of foreign ministers from China and African countries at the UN headquarters in New York.
Foreign Ministers of current African Security Council member Ce d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Jono, South Africa Foreign Minister Pandol and incoming member Niger Foreign Minister Kala, Tunisian Foreign Minister Jaish Nawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, we must unite to create strength.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism.The immediate consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are being challenged and the role of the United Nations is being undermined, to the detriment of the interests of the vast number of developing countries, including African countries and small and medium-sized countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, unity is the strength.
In the Security Council, the three African nations speak with one voice, focusing not on three votes but on the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just by four votes, but by driving others to follow, influencing and shaping the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council.
Second, settle disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hot-spot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has had successful good offices experience in African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
Together, we will make good use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter and play the role of the UN in good offices, mediation and so on.
Third, self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know best about African problems, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In dealing with Africa's hot issues, the Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting Africa's wishes, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions emanating from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and resolutely promote the capacity building of African independent peace operations.
Fourth, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We must put economic and social development first and mutually support each other's choices for development.
China is ready to join hands closely with the AU Agenda 2063, the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in African development.
China has given and will continue to give full support to the Congolese Ebola outbreak, providing human and material assistance to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate action with African countries, mobilize the United Nations and WHO to increase assistance, so as to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (UNSM Congo) well.

Trudeau's Manning Collapses, Can He Be Successfully Reelected
This time it was Trudeau himself who dug the "great pit" that had tripped him up.
Recently, the Canadian media has repeatedly exposed a number of old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed up as a black image.
It was deemed a clear act of racial discrimination and prompted an uproar in Canada.
After it happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, don't buy much of it.
Trudeau managed to lift the stone and smash his own foot.
Since the rise of the anti-blackface movement in the United States, Mr. Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party, as political commentators such as Mr. Riley have pointed out, have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or their own dissidents of “gaffes” and repeatedly threatening that “whoever makes this mistake should be expelled immediately”.
In short, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "great pit" that had tripped him up.
The son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau was a handsome young man who had a whirlwind of "political icons" in his early days.
Originally a political vegetarian, he took over as head of the federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly handsome 2015 federal legislative election in which the party won a majority of seats in the lower house and the prized right to form a separate government.
At that time, Trudeau proposed many promising platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "eco-environment" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "unhealthy practices".
However, for five years in office, he has "moved upwards and downwards" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
Ethnic and gender equality issues aside, the Blackface incident follows a series of rhetorical failures on indigenous issues that led indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to the Capitol gates on Canada's 150th anniversary.
In the fight against corruption, Mr Trudeau became embroiled in the "Lan Wan Ling" scandal at the beginning of last year.
It was revealed that his hometown's construction company "Lan Wanling" major irregularities and malpractices, to investigate the departments and officials in charge of pressuring the latter "high-handed.
Moreover, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the wrongdoing Chaudi Wang, who was the first Canadian attorney-general to disclose wrongdoing and handle cases directly.
Although the case itself still has doubts, but its suspicions are difficult to wash.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau's five years in power was largely the result of his own planing a pit, the biggest of which was "the head of a tiger and the tail of a snake" and "the tolerance of the law and the strictness of the law.
Since 2015, according to the most authoritative Angus Reed poll, support for Trudeau has slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opposition has soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Even a significant number of voters who would still prefer to vote for the federal Liberals are now dismissive of the federal prime minister, the head of the ruling party, despite similarly poor performances by other opposition parties and their leaders.
With a new federal legislative election looming on October 21, can Mr. Trudeau repeat the winning streak of five years ago?
The answer is probably one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
Beijing Daxing International Airport opened to traffic on September 25.
The opening of Daxing International Airport, which is already in super-saturated condition, will enhance the capability of the capital's aviation services, Xinjing News reported from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission.
After Shanghai, Beijing becomes the second city in China to have two airports in the same city.It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international aviation.
Daxing airport, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more of a positive impact.
Passenger throughput at the capital's airport topped 100m in 2018, the highest in the country, but there is still a significant capacity shortfall compared with fast-growing business demand, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism, business travel and other purposes, and adapt to the development trend of an increasingly open and internationally connected city in Beijing, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, with a plan to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million and the cargo and postal throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, there is also sufficient market space.
From the point of view of economic accounts, Daxing International Airport's air traffic, will obviously form a win-win effect, ease Beijing's air capacity tension, speed up passenger and cargo throughput growth rate, build the capital's dual-core operation of the incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with Daxing International Airport's traffic, the future does not have to be concentrated in the capital airport travel, you can also reduce the route too concentrated brought about by a series of problems, such as longer transit guarantee time, passengers boarding speed slower, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers in the airport detention time, exacerbate the burden of airport operation, through the capital airport transportation load reduction, in fact, improved passengers' travel experience.
According to the media to a variety of transportation routes to the large international airport calculated time and cost, such as from the South Ring Road to take the Beijing Expressway directly on the Daxing Airport Expressway, a 50-minute drive can be reached, fuel money around 40 yuan, the high-speed fare 15 yuan; and the choice of rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line, the distance according to the distance of 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, fares are divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan; citizens can also take the inter-city Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station as long as 20 minutes.
Generally speaking, citizens to Daxing Airport have a variety of transportation options, the cost and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing airport is located as a transportation hub of Beijing, Tianjin and Jiangxi, so it is a little far from Beijing, but it strengthens the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, makes it easier for more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers can enjoy Daxing International Airport to provide more international airline services, which Daxing Airport's traffic planning can be seen.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to Beijing directly to Daxing Airport's new airport line, there are many highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Guangdong, Dongguan, Foshan and Qingyuan can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangzhou-Guangdong-Guangdong Expressway, residents from neighboring Langfang and Xiong'an New Areas in Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport's convenient and efficient air services.
From this, we can see that Daxing International Airport's air traffic is not just an increase of a few runways and a few aircraft.It has far-reaching and positive significance in terms of enterprise competition, consumer experience, as well as regional aviation integration and integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development.It not only concerns the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also provides diversified choices for the residents of Beijing to travel, promotes the service quality of Beijing's shipping industry, and is conducive to the integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development process and economic and trade development around Daxing International Airport.
Therefore, to Daxing airport's aviation, we should not only calculate individual small accounts, but also the overall development of the big accounts.

2019 Vietnamese Forum on Economic and Social Issues to be held in Chengtian Shunhua Province
Nguyen Dungin, deputy chairman of Vietnam's parliamentary economic committee, said the country's economic and social development showed many new signs at the beginning of this year and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
During the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views on the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, prominent issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, prominent issues in Vietnam's social and cultural development in 2019 and forecasts and proposals for the country's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally agreed that global growth slowed and risks and challenges increased in the first few months of 2019.
Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed that despite uncertainty in the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world's economies have stagnated, Vietnam's economic development has made many welcome achievements, with a stable macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year.
Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting of Vietnam, said that against the backdrop of world economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy will show relatively high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of the FTAs will help trade development, economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Vietnam's export activities will decline due to trade frictions.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the early warning mechanism for monitoring and forecasting, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese export commodities, seek opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, we will keep inflation at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance and promote common development, and made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
Liu said that as the world's second largest economy, China has contributed more than 30 percent to world economic growth.
He said this year marks the 61-year anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.The two countries enjoy fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation will be a driving force for economic and social development in the region.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province highly commended the great achievements made by New China over the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
Desihab looked forward to the two sides continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and constantly improve people's living standards.
Siam Province's friendly exchanges with China's provinces and municipalities have been remarkable.So far, 28 provinces and municipalities have concluded friendly city relations with China, and large-scale cultural and performing arts projects such as Angkor Smile and Angkor Dynasty, the Siam-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siam New International Airport project, special training courses for Siam provincial government officials, scholarships for Siam students to study in China, voluntary rural clinics, the construction and renovation of urban roads, and the cataract rehabilitation and public welfare project "Bright Walk" have yielded fruitful results.
State Secretary of the Cambodian Ministry of Defence Ken Wensong, Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council Weng Heng, Governor of the five provinces of the territory, the Siem Reap Sub-committee of the Cambodia-China Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap Sub-committee of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese-funded enterprises and representatives of foreign missions in Siem Reap attended the reception.
A decade of digital China witnessed in Yunqi town - Xinhua News Agency
If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou held in 2019 annual meeting has passed a full decade.
From the concept of “in the cloud” to the practice of “on the cloud”, the big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China’s economic development, social management and public services in the past decade.
At Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Plant in Haining, Zhejiang Province, new "colleagues" loaded with Aliyun's artificial intelligence were recently spotted beside quality inspectors.
Its 24-hour, identification speed is more than twice that of the manual, quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
The camera-equipped inspector has concentrated on studying more than 40,000 defective samples and, thanks to the computing power behind cloud computing, can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and classify faulty batteries, according to company chiefs.
The company is a microcosm of the transformation that cloud computing is helping to transform manufacturing today.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Implementation Guide for Promoting Enterprises to Go Cloud ( 2018-2020), which proposes that by 2020, enterprises should strive to achieve a marked increase in awareness and enthusiasm for going to the cloud and a marked increase in the proportion and depth of its application.
Today, says Wang Jian, Aliyun's founder, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for a digital economy in which data is the key ingredient.
Meanwhile, the scale of cloud computing industry in China has been expanding continuously in the past 10 years.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development 2019 released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, the total market size of cloud computing in China will reach 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 percent over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
This year's Cloud Habitat Conference, for three years in a row, the "urban brain" is still attracting attention.
At present, the urban brain has been transformed from a transportation management tool into a city management center, and the cooperative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world, said Ali Yun.
Through the camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain through the powerful computing power, "park first, pay later" "real-time perception of the number of visits" "tour line design" and other new urban management services can be realized.
In the field of government service, cloud computing brings convenience to both sides of the supply of government service.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform through the government affairs to the cloud.
By September 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and 15 million legal entities in the province, compiling 19.08 billion entries in the 3066 category of governance.
Zhejiang province's inter-departmental average monthly call, the sharing of data has reached 12 million, data flow on the 'cloud' for every more calls, may mean that the masses do less errands.
Carefully use plastic tea bags to make tea!
A new Canadian study has found that a packet of plastic tea bags could release billions or even tens of billions of tiny particles, significantly more than a person could estimate for a year, but there is no evidence that consumption of the tiny particles poses a threat to humans, China Central News Agency reported.
Researchers at Canada's Magill University reported that soaking plastic tea bags in a cup of nearly boiling water (95 degrees Celsius) released about 1.16 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount.
In the study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags at Montelo shops and coffee shops. The bags were opened, washed, submerged in nearly boiling water for five minutes, and then analyzed with an electron microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 1.16 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than the previous plastic load on other foods".
Most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many brands that use them still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some brands have switched from paper to plastic tea bags, which the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define as being between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size and are produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers found plastic particles in human excrement samples from several countries in different regions of the world for the first time in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of tea-covered plastic particles, the Canadian team put water fleas in contaminated water and found that the microplastics affected their behavior and deformed their development.
According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to date that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO says more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what their impact on humans is.
The researchers speculate that the release of large quantities of plastic particles in the tea bags may have been due to contact with boiling water, where even "food grade" plastics can break down or leach toxic substances when heated above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the greatest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster could erode the development achievements of a generation.
This has been illustrated by the devastation of hurricanes that have hit Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas this year.
About a quarter of people in SIDS live at altitudes of 5 metres or less.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life, and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
Small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction at Monday's Climate Action Summit as they work together to achieve carbon neutrality and 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones.
Despite their small contribution to global warming, small island developing States pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance to be sought in small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-adaptive infrastructure and in methods of transition to renewable energy, and urging international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, to obtain financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released this week, confirms that the oceans have suffered "engulfing" severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, extreme sea-level rise that would have occurred only once a century is likely to occur annually in many areas.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken their toll.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also trying to cope with the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging of circumstances, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples for the world to learn from.
He emphasized that small island developing States constituted a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is sufficiently liquid.
India's economy is expected to pick up in the second half of this fiscal year, thanks to holiday spending demand, as the financial system becomes more liquid, Finance Minister Manmohan Sitaraman said on Tuesday.
Sitaraman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions.
Sitaraman did not specify where the remarks were aimed.
Some Indian and overseas media have blamed the continuing slowdown on liquidity constraints at non-bank financial institutions.
Citing falling auto sales as an example, Mr Sitaraman rejected the idea that liquidity constraints were the main reason for the decline.
Mr Sitaraman said the fall in car sales was largely due to cyclical factors.
Mr. Sitaraman expects growth to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and lasts until the end of the year.
The market expects that the shopping consumption will greatly promote India's economic growth.

<unk>淪ome of the sites are estimated to have more than half of the over-aged migrant workers.
Where can I find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many elderly people on the site.
Recently, on the construction site there are many over-age migrant workers (over the retirement age) phenomenon, long in the construction contractor Zou Kui said.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities for the rain and sewage diversion project, there are a lot of migrant workers on campus, if you pay attention to the observation, there will be a lot of over-age migrant workers.
It is not because they cannot be idle that overaged migrant workers go out to work. It is because they cannot be idle that the helplessness and hardship of having to do so--whether saving money to solve their pension and medical problems, or helping their children--are driving these old people who should be idle to continue their hard work.
The over-aged migrant workers are not as easy to rely on as we thought.
When these migrant workers have completed their "mission of life", their moneybags have been emptied and there are even many debts.Most of them lack the means to accumulate wealth.
In order not to put off their children and in order to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until the end of dry. "
The reluctance of many new generations of migrant workers in the "80s, " "90s and even "00s to work in hard-pressed, high-intensity secondary or low-end service industries has created a structural "job shortage", and these unattractive jobs have provided opportunities for overaged migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills, physical functions and labor capacity declined, many overaged migrant workers are doing work of great intensity, low income, high risk and little security.
Being able to work day by day and earning a little bit more, the plight of the overaged migrant workers behind the "cannot be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
Apart from their "self-redemption", it is also inseparable from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector to solve the problems of underpayment and salary claim, improve labour protection, reduce safety risks, increase labour income and improve the living conditions of overaged migrant workers.
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on farming to solve their pension and medical problems, they have to adopt other ways to support their families.
To understand the helplessness and strength of the over-aged migrant workers, helps us better understand the love and pain of the over-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the back of over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs and trying to find ways to let them return to the countryside to truly realize the "old dependency", it is necessary for the public sector, the market and society to share the responsibility in the benign interaction, it is necessary for all parties to work together.
Russia will not export such a system for the next five years, he said, because “it will first be supplied to the army and then exported”.
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glihov, deputy commander of Russia's Sky Forces, said development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by Diamond-Antee Aerospace Defense Corporation.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft system that uses the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
Furthermore, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles travelling five times the speed of sound, and even targets located in near space.
The weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, particularly the S-400, which is important from a defense perspective.
Sergei Chmaytsov has expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in high demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system of the Arctic Air Defense Regiment of New Isle has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
Russia's defence ministry says this is all part of a transition plan to more advanced defensive tools in the northern strategic direction.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has significantly increased," the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service said.
Most importantly, the military has assessed the successful use of the system in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air defense regiment officers and men for the new system has been trained and ready to enter the battle duty.
It was previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, which is still part of it.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of aerial targets, be they high-speed targets at outer altitudes or "leaky fish" approaching protected installations.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph, developed by Golden Diamond Aetna Air Defense, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can strike aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 kilometers and take down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometers per second at a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never hidden that it will deploy additional air defenses in the Arctic to ensure the safety of its airspace over the North Sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defence battalion and strengthen the Arctic air defence system.
Russia's defence ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Tor" force will be expanded to the full brigade-level system in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed to Xinjiang and the Kola peninsula, and the Panzer-SA short-range systems deployed to the Arctic, these advanced air defense weapons effectively defend Russia's polar skies.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and UAV missiles will be very difficult to break through this defense.
According to the government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complicated and lengthy process of setting up shop on their own.
As the operator of Russian goods stores, russian products multi-company focuses on the sale of Russian goods in China.
Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, Wechat, a multi-functional instant messaging software, are among the largest trading platforms in China. They all have online stores and have their own online platforms, Epinduo.com and Russian retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with OPT to develop store marketing strategies and participation criteria and screen virtual shelf-to-shelf product companies.
Stores are scheduled to open by the end of this year and stock products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits to China's electricity platforms are up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and will exceed $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will now open pilot stores selling goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
The new stores will display the goods of companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more, Aleksey Khetnikov said.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher. 500 million rubles in sales is not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods, treating our goods as high quality and environmentally friendly products.
Competition for Chinese consumers, who have a lot of purchasing power, is fierce and intensifying, he said.
"Our aim is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses over three years through this store, " he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of enterprises in the Russian Far East.
"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centres are state-owned rather than private institutions," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Department of Trade Policy Foundations at the Plekhanov Economic University in Russia.
<unk>淚 don't see a lot of Russian goods that are very competitive on the market.<unk>?
He thinks the project may not actually be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of Russia's Export Center, said on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian companies' products have been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be bought in China and other countries.
There is also a model for working with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July.
The Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of trade exhibitions and business projects for Russian enterprises at the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
Large-scale exhibitions will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the center for business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotional meetings and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre stated: "In addition to the agricultural stands, we will certainly hold business meetings, i.e., arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
“This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the Expo will also hold masterclasses, cooking contests and "explore the Shanghai Station of Russian cuisine" project of Russian chefs cooking Russian American food tasting.
After the coroner's verdict of non-accidental death on Friday, the police awaited the full report and the directions of the General Prosecution Service to take the next step.
In a statement issued Friday, National Police Criminal Investigation Directorate Governor Numan al-Huzr said police would await the latest instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office in light of the coroner's ruling.
In his statement, he stressed that the police investigation into Mohamoud's death has never been terminated, and the investigation is still ongoing.
On the other hand, Sheriff Noah-Ghan said police would wait for a full report on the verdict before taking action.

Xinhua Times Review: We Will Steadfastly Follow Our Own Way
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have followed it unswervingly.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China should follow a development path that suits it.
Since modern times, in poverty and weakness, internal and external problems in the environment, generations of benevolence to explore the way to save the country and save the people up and down the search, go.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all been thought about, tried, and failed to work".
Only with the Communist Party of China and the New China did the Chinese people gradually carve out a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of rejuvenation for the Chinese nation and the path of common development between China and other countries in the world.
It is precisely because China is on the right track that it can do its job well, become the world's second largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, which is in line with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, will show more and more bright prospects of development as the times advance.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it was to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
Chinese people understand the truth of the northern orange, understand that the suitability of others may not suit themselves, only suit their own is the best.
It is with this kind of road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the world's attention-grabbing miracle.
In the tortuous process of human advancement, the "end of history" was once famous.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the "end of history", the collapse of the "China collapse" and the failure of the "socialist failure".
China's success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries in achieving national wealth and a stronger people, expanded the way for the developing countries to move towards modernization, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who wish to pursue a path consistent with their own national conditions while simultaneously accelerating development and maintaining their own independence.
The world is a colorful place.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
Instead of "importing" foreign models or "exporting" Chinese models, China will steadfastly follow its own path and realize its own continuous development, strengthen governance and exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance.
A Foodworks supermarket boss has been slammed as “disgraceful” for sacking a 66-year-old woman worker by text message after the Fair Work Commission found he preferred to employ people from Asian backgrounds.
The commission said that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang (Eddie), who had worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, had treated employees in a "deeply unfair" manner and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been “trying to fire me” because she was not Chinese.
In the case, Peter Sams, vice-chairman of the commission, conducted an internet search and found “some job advertisements posted by Mr Wang in the past on various Australian Chinese employment forums”.
Among the job requirements listed, one said "Asian women preferred" and the other "Asian staff preferred".
A third post said he was "more inclined to overseas (sic) " .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton in April by text message, later citing her absence and an alleged lack of cash at the cash register, ranging from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She had missed only one shift in three years, and the "missing sum" amounted to a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "actually irrelevant to her conduct or performance".
He said: "In my opinion, supported by the evidence in Mr. Wang's advertisement, the defendant's real motive for dismissing her was his preference for hiring staff with Asian backgrounds.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct, which ostensibly constitutes a breach of anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of an applicant, is unlawful."
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton, given her "appalling" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a casual worker earning A$26 an hour.
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his ruling and papers to the committee's directors to consider whether Mr Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to her alleged reasons for firing her.
He said: "I believe that the Advocate has resorted to an irredeemably unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant and that Mr. Wang has "waited" for this opportunity, which in his view would "justify" the termination of the employment of the applicant."
"He was wrong ... that in dismissing the applicant the defence completely ignored any natural justice accorded her and that, shockingly, his perfunctory behaviour was disrespectful and grossly unfair."
Although Foodworks is a small business, Mr. Sams said, “it must be said bluntly that no decent employer would fire an employee in the grossly unfair and perfunctory manner acknowledged in this case.”
He said: "This is disgraceful and extremely unfair."

Six denied selling fake baby rolls in Supreme Court
Six men suspected of forging and selling Chinese passports, birth certificates and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Name Registration Office and a businessman with a supervisory rank, appeared before a magistrate on Thursday to face charges relating to anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking of migrants.
The defence lawyer who originally represented the Chinese-Nattyu defendant, Li Zhenhua, also a Sunset Hole congressman, applied to the judge to withdraw from representing the defendant.
He said he had drawn criticism from political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his Action Party had been implicated.

World's oldest hairdresser dies at 108 Having a haircut for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest certified hairdresser, has died of complications from jaw cancer in New York, the United States.At 108 years old, he never retired and worked diligently every day to cut hair for clients.
Mancinelli immigrated to the U.S. when he was 8 years old and soon helped clean the floor at a barber's. He began using scissors as a 12 year old to relieve financial pressure on his family, CNN reported.
Although he attended elementary school at the time, Mancini did not graduate.
Mancini's son, Robert, said his father loved to work and people all over the world liked him. But despite his good health, he was diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before he died.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new hairdresser after his father died because he had let him cut his hair all his life.
Repurchases of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan in 2008 - Xinhua
In order to stabilize the stock price and maintain the image of the company, the listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently in the past two years.They hope to pass the message of undervaluation to the market through directed buybacks and collective bidding, thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing the confidence of investors.
The amount spent on share repurchases by listed companies in 2017 was 7.9 billion yuan, rising sharply to 5.1 billion yuan in 2018, according to Oriental Wealth Choice.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's share repurchase seems to be the same as the majority shareholder's increase.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., told Securities Daily that the November 2018 Opinion on Supporting Share Repurchase by Listed Companies, which addresses issues such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and an inadequate inventory system, resulted in a huge increase in share repurchase by listed companies since they were encouraged to repurchase shares on policy grounds.
In January, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges formally promulgated the Implementation Rules on Share Repurchase by Listed Companies.These policies have broadened the sources of funds for share repurchase by listed companies, simplified implementation procedures appropriately, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement share incentive or employee shareholding schemes.
After the opinion, listed companies share repurchase operations, with more applicable situations, repurchase process is simpler, share repurchase enthusiasm is also greater.
Repurchasing shares in a relatively low position is also beneficial to the listed companies to improve the efficiency of capital use, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, raising the return on equity and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
Compared with the large shareholders' increasing holdings, the listed company's share repurchase is more significant, which also reflects the willingness of active market capitalization management and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued share price is the main factor of the listed company's repurchase, the company's share price can not reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can not blindly invest in such listed companies, we need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies as well as the specific operating conditions.
The large-scale repurchase behavior of listed companies, at least indicates the company's development confidence and capital strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for A-share repurchases by listed companies has also normalized repurchases, with data showing that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the repurchase market.
Ping An recently disclosed that it had repurchased 5.759 million A-shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company's total share capital, through a centralized bidding exercise.The total funds paid for the repurchase amounted to 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), and all of the repurchased shares would be used for the employee shareholding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan approved by the company's shareholders' meeting.
Yili shares have paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchase, and the use of share repurchase has recently been adjusted from “all share repurchases to be used as a source of late-stage share incentives” to “a cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used as a source of late-stage share incentives and the remaining 304.9 million shares will be written off to reduce registered capital”.
Illi shares said the write-off of some of its repurchased shares would further boost earnings per share levels and improve returns for shareholders.
TCL announced on September 25 that it had repurchased 3.59 per cent of its shares at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
TCL's board office told Securities Daily the share buybacks would be used for employee stock ownership programs, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established management strategy, continuously improve competitiveness, sustainable and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the interests of investors, combining the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market over the past year, and taking into account such factors as the company's operations and financial situation, the company plans to repurchase the company's shares using its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods.
Yang Delong, chief economist at Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, said the share repurchase by listed companies was an important positive for secondary market shares by reducing the number of shares in circulation and increasing earnings per share.
Repurchase of listed companies in China has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the high-performing stocks. It is a very good way to invigorate investors' confidence through share repurchase.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee, is one of the four heads of the Hunan army for engineering machinery manufacturing Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang have set a small goal around Changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster after 35 years.
In Changsha to create the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, to use the current fashionable words, is to create the "strongest surface. "
As the inland capital of the city, Changsha shouted out this heroic words, the bottom line?
By the power of bullying side leakage.
The four Xiang enterprises participating in the dialogue are well-versed in the fields of engineering, namely, light aircraft with intelligence of mountains and rivers, concrete conveying pumps of Zhonglian Heavy Industries, all-ground cranes of Trinity Heavy Industries and tunnel shielding machines of Iron Construction Heavy Industries.
There was a time when China had little say in the manufacture of engineering machinery.
Time flies, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go abroad" two-wheel drive, aboard the east wind of "global economic development" initiative, acquisitions, mergers, plants and other measures, a leap into the global engineering machinery industry's leading position.
Among them, the leading enterprises in engineering machinery, such as Trinity Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries and Shanhe Intelligence, have taken a substantial lead in major economic indicators such as output value, market share and sales.
By the camera and move the time control.
Xiangjun "Four Golden Gangs" of engineering machinery, is the leader of Changsha engineering machinery industry cluster, is also the head of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the world of industry, who can live, and live well, is the hard way to speak.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturers have fallen, but the Changsha engineering machinery manufacturers "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intellectual change, not only survived, but also strengthened their bodies.
By the stars of the moon's political enterprises with the force.
The development of advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be active and the government to be active.
Changsha has a reputation as the capital of engineering machinery because it has assembled the entire industrial chain from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, built up clusters of related industries, and reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises come.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building a world-leading level of engineering machinery, when not to wait, when not to let.
Both the government and enterprises, as well as the relevant producers, researchers and businessmen, should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set their goals and make sustained efforts to contribute to the building of a strong manufacturing country.

Zou Tao said, in order to prevent epidemic, also need to spray disinfection sheep sheds periodically, to sheep quarterly hit three to four anti-epidemic shots.
Besides living well, the sheep had to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheat grass and alfalfa, and had a wide enough playground to stretch their muscles.
Cooperatives shall adopt the method of trusteeship and substitution to guide local farmers in placing well-bred lakes and sheep in such a place for unified breeding, management and marketing, so as to realize good breeding, scientific breeding, standardization and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poverty-stricken households receive more than 6,000 yuan in dividends each year, and four of them work in co-operative societies.
In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat sheep farming is not only a change in the way of feeding, but also a change in the pattern of leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers who once raised sheep on hillsides and sold them in markets.
If market prices are weak, Mr. Zou said, local leader Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Animal husbandry Development Co., Ltd., will underwrite the acquisition with a market-protected price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general counsel of Gansu-based Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that more and more impoverished households are being encouraged to recite the Sutra of Sheep by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, quotation acquisition and unified processing and sales services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poverty-stricken households have achieved steady increases in income by joining Zhongsheng forage farming, breeding of good seeds, breeding on a large scale, butchery and marketing.

France's finance minister says more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts next year and calls on Germany to follow up
(Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should follow France's fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing initiatives created an opportunity for more investment by governments in countries that could afford it.
The ECB cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart borrowing to keep borrowing costs down, hoping to spur an economic recovery and boost inflation.
"Low interest rates will not restore Europe to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient, " Mr Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs investment, it needs it now, as soon as possible. Don't wait for things to get worse, " he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already implemented more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, giving it a big boost to economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum, with export-dependent Germany bearing the brunt.
Le Maire noted that next year the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros in income tax cuts.
In addition, the tax burden on companies will be reduced by nearly 1bn euros as the corporate tax rate is phased in over a five-year period from 33.3% to 25%.

Study: Slight but challenging increase in U.S. National Health Eating Index
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/opinion/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday/sunday
But with a full score of 100, it's not a cause for celebration.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diets.
Dr. Fangfang Zhang, one of the study's authors and a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans were still eating too much food that could lead to heart disease, diabetes and obesity, the nation's most common diseases.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Thursday.
The study was based on a U.S. government health survey of 44, 000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that "despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges persist".
The challenges include getting Americans to cut back on snacks, hot dogs, fatty cows and butter that contain saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended 10 percent limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent, but consumption remained too high.
Officially, added sugars should be less than 10 per cent of the daily diet.
The researchers linked the decrease in sugar intake to a decrease in the consumption of sweetened soft drinks, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
American adults experienced small increases in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grains.
However, the figures for 2016 show that these foods still make up less than 5 per cent of the diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and reduced consumption of fruit juices, low-quality carbohydrates still account for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white breads and other refined grains, according to Zhang.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that ask adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government-issued Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend adopting a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines say people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and protein-rich foods such as seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs and seeds.
The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled, by more than seven percent, and the obesity rate increased over the years about 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.

Everbright Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Everbright Financial Services Co., Ltd. was formally established in Qingdao, China's first joint-stock banking financial services subsidiary.
Experts said that asset management is an important area of financial technology development, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries is conducive to the use of technology to enhance its management business.
In April, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank separately announced that they had received approval from the CBRC to set up a wealth management subsidiary.
On September 24th, Everbright Bank announced that it had been officially allowed to open its new branch.
Just 2 days later, Everbright Bank led a number of joint-stock banks, the first to set up in Qingdao Everbright Banking.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright, said Everbright will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, rely on big data, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and enhance the sense of acquisition, well-being and security of customers.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four pillars" of financial science and technology development in China, further strengthen the application capability of science and technology in the financial sector, realize the deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science and technology, and significantly enhance people's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial Services, said the company's management platform will use technology such as smart accounting, smart research and big data to help Everbright Financial Services better judge the macroeconomic situation.
The future will also apply new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital assets.
Dong Ximiao, a specially-hired researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that in the new competitive situation facing the management industry, financial technology companies and regulators will use management technology to explore new growth paths.
Financial science and technology endows with new vitality and vitality for the development of management business, which is not only the need of financial science and technology's own transformation and development.
Earlier this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new management technology system to enhance its product R&D and wind control capabilities with the help of technology and digitization.
The new system starts from the four capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment, and improves the overall intellectualized operational level of the management industry.
Experts believe that while improving customer service capabilities and innovative products, management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve management efficiency.
According to Zhang, whereas in the past it was easy to locate customers' risk preferences by using questionnaires, the use of artificial intelligence in user portraits has helped to better locate customers and defuse risks by launching products according to their investment preferences.
"Other big data, such as electricity generation and spatiotemporal data, can help us better characterize a region and an industry's activity and prosperity. "
While mitigating risks, the big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities, Zhang said.
Record for deepest tunnel shaft in China's railways set
Zhang Weiming Zhou Jingbo Zhongshan News Agency September 27 (Zhang Weiming Xu for the country after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, in Jianda (Li) Rui (Li) railway Gaoligongshan tunnel shaft 1 completed on the 27th, the depth of the well reached below the ground 762.59 meters, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shafts, and this record was set in the flooding situation.
Located in Yunnan Province, the 34.5-kilometer-long DaRui Railway tunnel runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the Jiangxi coast. It is the longest double-track tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 faults and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres.Because it covers almost all of the possible adverse geology and major risks involved in tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is known as the “Geological Museum” of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel in Gaoligongshan Tunnel. It is an important task to increase the operating area to realize the "long tunnel short-strike" and ventilation in the later period of railway operation.
Shaft No.1 has been successfully excavated to the bottom of the tunnel.This marks the formal entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction.After the excavation of the underground car yard and the replacement of the equipment, four additional working faces will be added to the underground shaft to speed up the opening of the main tunnel.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because there are more fissures in the granite formation and the water can't stop.
Zhong Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Tairui Railway Project Department of the tunnel bureau, told reporters that during the shaft construction, there were many dangers such as mud inrush and water gushing, collapse, and the construction side invited experts to the site and discussed the treatment plan more than 20 times.
"When the shaft is at its maximum, the water flows in at more than 300 cubic meters per hour, at a depth of more than 700 meters, and the pressure is equivalent to 700 meters of seafloor.
"If we don't pump and drain in time, 10 meters will be flooded in an hour, " Mr. Si said.
In order to overcome the problems of the longitudinal joint development, mud inrush, water-rich granite and so on in the surrounding rock of Shaft No. 1, the systemic water control measures combining exploration, injection and excavation are adopted in tunnel construction to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, mechanized assembly lines for excavation system, ballast system, suspension system and winch lifting system have been formed in the construction of Shaft 1.
Eventually, the shaft was dug at a depth of 762. 59 meters after more than 1, 200 days and nights of construction.
With a total length of 330 kilometers, the Dalian-Burma Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "China-Pacific Economic Cooperation" strategy.
Upon completion of the project, the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours.This will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western part of Yunnan, and promote the economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries.

Will MCA stand in the by-election for the conference seat of Thanongai in Johor State?
MCA President Nathan Sri - wei Ka - hsiang : " To the Supreme Council of the National Front discussion! "
With the by-election for the Dandong Biai seat looming, it is of great concern whether BN's Ma Hua will take up the traditional seat.
However, after a meeting of the MCA Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of BN would decide whether the traditional MCA seat should continue to be given to MCA or be replaced by another party member.
Any by-election will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP), which require a decision to be made after the Supreme Council of BN meets, Wei told the media after chairing a meeting of the FMC on Thursday afternoon.
He said the NIF Supreme Council meeting is expected in early October because the electoral commission will not meet until next Monday to finalize the by-election.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with BN Chairman Governor Nasri Amarzahi and we all agreed that this seat must be reclaimed from the Hope League. "
"We have hammered out a special BN leaders' meeting in early October, at which the heads of the three parties will decide which party will take charge. "
Asked whether the MCA would insist on taking up the traditional seat in the Supreme Council of BN, Mr Wei reiterated that, as President of MCA, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision should be taken by consensus of BN.
It is not uncommon in any by-election for someone to come out, for a party to come out, for a party to think they should come out.
"The most important thing is from what organization and political coalition?
"This is a great test of our political union over the years, and we believe that BN has carried forward some valuable values along the way.
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process. "
"But once the Supreme Council of BN has made a decision, we must prepare for war with all our strength, that is the most precious thing. "
In any event, Mr. Wei said, MCA will make every effort to prepare for the upcoming by-election by the District Councils, the State Councils and the Central Committee.
"On the district council side, the chairman of the district council (Dansu Biai), Nathan Sze-ri Huang-sun, will lead; the state council, Nathan Lam-pei-hing, will lead; and the central committee, Nathan Mahan-shun, the acting chairman, and Nathan Cheung-sheng, the general secretary, will be personally deployed.

A villager was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15420 yuan (the same as below) in damages to ecological resources and environment.
Because of the poverty of the accused's family, the procuratorial organs started to use alternative labor compensation for ecological rehabilitation, thus realizing the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy chief prosecutor of Baokang County Prosecutor's Office, said on the 27th, through three months of "compulsory mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou has established a profound relationship with wild monkeys and hunting animals before the deep sense of self-reproach.
On June 21 this year, Baokang County Prosecutor's Office filed in the field of ecological resources of a criminal incidental civil public interest litigation case, in the county court open trial and sentenced in court.
Zhou was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of three years, suspended for four years, and fined 3000 yuan, while ordering him to pay 15420 yuan in compensation for damages to ecological resources and environment.
According to the investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid at the cliff in late January 2014, and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including impala, small suede and crested deer.
The impala belongs to the State second-class endangered wildlife protection animals, small suede, hairy crested deer are listed as the "National Land Wildlife Protection List".
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his wrongful facts and behavior, and willing to bear the incidental civil liabilities.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of Baokang County Prosecutor's Office, the local village committee, forest station and Zhou have reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological rehabilitation expenses: namely, Zhou can provide public welfare services to offset the ecological rehabilitation expenses by carrying out the work of macaque domestication and management in the village macaque reserve, compulsory mountain patrol and forest protection for one year.
The court approved the prosecutor's recommendation that Zhou, while serving a suspended sentence, actively fulfill his obligation of "substitutive labor compensation for ecological rehabilitation" .
At present, Zhou has been in the macaque sanctuary volunteer work for three months, active mountain patrol, good performance.
In recent years, the procuratorate of Baokang County has integrated procuratorial functions and social governance in practice, scientifically applied procuratorial suggestions, investigative supervision and litigation supervision, and by judicial means minimized the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts.
United Nations awards " Guardian of the Earth Award " to ant forest
Amid loud applause and loud music, "Ants Forest" project leader Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang took to the podium to receive the 2019 United Nations "Guardians of the Earth" trophy from the hosts.
26 (Xinhua) -- An ant forest project that uses small mobile phone programs to get hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental activism has won the "Incentive and Action Award" at the 2019 Guardians of the Earth Awards in New York.
The United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners a week ago at its headquarters in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, but there was still a sense of excitement among those attending the ceremony.
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Ying Er Annozen, told Xinhua that the ant forest is an exciting innovation that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing mankind and what mankind can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in protecting the planet, which will have a huge impact.
Launched in August 2016 on Alipay platform by China Ant Financial Services Group, users can "plant trees" on their mobile phones by saving "green energy" through low-carbon activities such as logging green trips in their daily lives and paying water and electricity bills online.
For each virtual tree created by the user, Ant Forest and its public-interest partners will plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August, 500 million users of the ant forest had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tonnes and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado hailed the ant forest's contributions as "impressive in inspiring so many people to take part in green action" at a ceremony honoring the country's environmental efforts at the Guardians of the Earth Awards.
Ji Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ants Golden Suit, said the award recognised the Ants Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon living, an honor that belongs to all participants.
The ant forests have affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal for the next three years is to get 1 billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon initiatives, according to Mr Jii.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from green mountains and rivers.
Besides providing employment opportunities by planting trees, it hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural development projects and electricity generation platforms.
The ant forest's digital technology-based model of public welfare and environmental protection has also been successfully used by other countries.
In June, the Philippines' largest e-wallet, GCash, launched a Philippine version of the ant forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
Working with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental advocacy groups, GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, he said.
The "Guardians of the Earth Award" is the UN's highest award in the field of environmental protection, awarded annually.
The prize for Ant Forest is the third consecutive incentive and action prize awarded to green innovation projects in China, following the thousand-village demonstration and improvement project in Zhejiang Province of China, a builder of the Saihanba forest farm.
Economic and trade frictions affect U. S. economic report card.
US gross domestic product growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter, hurt by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, according to US economic “resumes” for the second quarter of this year.
Analysts pointed to economic friction and uncertainty as the main cause of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the second quarter, according to the final revised figures released by the US Commerce Department on Monday, which were unchanged from the previous revised figures but markedly lower than the 3.1 per cent growth recorded in the first quarter.
Consumption growth was the main factor supporting US growth in the second quarter, the data showed.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 percent in the quarter, driving growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage point.
In the second quarter, however, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points. Exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter, while net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner at Enside Macroeconomics, said that rather than maintaining last year's growth, private-sector investment had fallen sharply as rising economic friction and uncertainty hit business confidence.
Mr Knapp believes US corporate capital spending is still expected to fall next year amid policy uncertainty.
Analysts say while consumption growth provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic friction and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and weighed on the outlook for U.S. consumption.
Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said 38 percent of consumers in the latest survey mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy spontaneously, the highest percentage in more than a year and a half.
For the future of the U. S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U. S. economy will continue to slow.
But experts also say the performance of the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions are eased.
Kathleen Birch, a global economist at the Economists UK think tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its downward trend this year and grow at a lower rate than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts a 2.3 per cent growth rate this year and a further slowdown to 1.6 per cent next, assuming no further escalation of trade frictions.
The biggest concern for companies right now is trade disputes and the uncertainty they create. If trade disputes are resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now, said Ellen Hatzen, investment manager at Patnam Investments.
Matt Merry, equity strategist at Miller-Taback Asset Management, said trade frictions remained the "number one issue" and a major cause of volatility in U.S. capital markets this year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off a year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is the embodiment of respect for and protection of human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress.
At the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on September 27, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a majority vote.
This is the first provincial-level local regulation of Ningxia formulated and promulgated for the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests, which will be formally implemented on November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007.The Regulations are divided into nine chapters, comprising 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and supplementary provisions.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, a first in the country.
In April, the State Council's General Office issued a guideline on promoting the development of care services for infants and children under the age of three that describes co-parenting.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has put forward a new proposal that "employers are encouraged to give ten days of joint parental leave per year to husband and wife who have children in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations, between the ages of zero and three".
At the same time, the Regulations highlighted anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in the compilation of personal rights in China's civil code, and details the constitutional requirements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms for combating sexual harassment.
Section 44 of the Ordinance specifically prohibits the frequency of vicious sexual assaults on girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work. It is a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates the right of women to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, so as to provide solid institutional support for women to safeguard their rights.
Furthermore, in response to the hot issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination but also prohibits indirect discrimination.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation Joint Public Inspection Division, the Civil Affairs Department and other departments have promoted and introduced social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and disputes and the anti-domestic violence work, with remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and promote this issue.A number of laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services, etc.

The field yield measurement of salt-tolerant and alkali-tolerant rice not only injected hope for promoting medium and low- and high-yielding fields in Xin'an alliance, but also provided scientific basis for planting rice in salt-alkali-tolerant fields under the same conditions in China.
After marathon debates and weeks of protests, Australia's newest state passed a law to legalize abortion on September 26, local time, news.com.au reported.
The legislation is understood to have sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with the Liberal Party deeply divided since independent MP Peter Greenwich announced it was introduced.
After nearly 40 hours of deliberations, the ANZ Senate approved the legislation by a vote of 26 to 14 on Tuesday night, making it the third-longest-running legislation in the state's Senate.
26 morning, after a final vote in the New State House of Representatives, to legalize abortion in the New State.
The bill allows women to terminate a pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation and, if two doctors agree, to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on Tuesday night that would allow doctors to consult a multidisciplinary panel of hospital advisory boards before performing an abortion on a woman 22 weeks into her pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include the requirement that doctors provide adequate care for babies who survive pregnancy terminations.
Earlier, the governor had faced public criticism from conservatives for stepping in several times to buy more debate time on the bill, but she did not appear on the final ballot.
Defending her absence from the polls, she said: "I need to spend time running the whole new state."
Mr Davis, a Liberal MP who was one of the most vocal opponents of the abortion bill, is said to have threatened to quit the new state government over the legislation, saying it caused a "government crisis".
But then Davis backed down.
Davis said: "The amendments to the abortion legalization bill, which were introduced in the House of Representatives on the 26th morning, actually provide women and doctors with more protection."
Meanwhile, the leader of Australia's New State National Party, Barry Lauro, said he was proud to be part of a government that legalized abortion.
What we achieved last night is historic for the new state. It legalizes abortion, it is no longer a crime, and it does not treat women who have abortions as criminals.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: Sixty-seven central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state funds to enrich the social security fund.
So far, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds, bringing the total transfer of state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Tuesday.
Liu Kun made the above remarks at the meeting jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and the Ministry of Social Security and the SASAC on the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund.
"The transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full expression of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises for all and the generational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system, and a policy measure based on the present and taking into account the long-term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for Transferring Some State-Owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds," which calls for selecting some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the early stage of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, transfers of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed in three batches, transferring a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital.
Among them, the Ministry of Finance has basically completed the transfer of central financial institutions to perform the duties of investors.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain size.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out.
By the end of 2018, pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces have basically been completed, transferring 15.8 billion yuan and 18.8 billion yuan of state-owned capital respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying the foundation for the next step.
According to a notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital by the central and local governments to enrich social security funds will be fully launched in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting convened that day made specific deployments for the overall deferral process.
The meeting stressed that the transfer work should be carried out pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
It's a tight schedule and a heavy task.
Liu said all regions and departments should organize meticulously and arrange meticulously to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, press ahead with the work, accurately grasp the policy contents of the transfer, strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
Transferring State Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund Starting from the point of "enriching the coffers of the Social Security Fund", the goal is to provide strong support for the old-age security.
However, the author thinks that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement" , but a "mathematical addition" .
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice Concerning the Comprehensive Expansion of the Work of Transferring Some State-owned Capital to Enhance Social Security Funds, specifying the timetable for transferring state-owned capital to social security funds, i.e., the central and local work of transferring some state-owned capital to enrich social security funds will be completed in 2019.
Treasury and other departments implemented the document very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred to the Social Security Fund 10 percent of the holdings of ICBC and Agricultural Bank, with the total value of the two transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan.
As financial investors, social security foundations and other undertaking entities enjoy the rights to income, disposal and knowledge of the state-owned shares.
ICBC and AgBank said in the announcement that the changes in equity will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
To this end, the author thinks, similar state-owned enterprises equity transfer is not a simple change of ownership, but can inspire a series of effects of "additive operation" .
The first step of transferring some state-owned capital to social security is "adding results", which can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by all and the sharing of development achievements by all.
After years of reform and development, the state-owned enterprises, especially the central-owned enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously to achieve a better big stronger.
On July 10, the State Council, at its executive meeting, decided to move forward the transfer of some state-owned capital to supplement the social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said it would work with relevant departments to fully promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, in accordance with the arrangements of the State Council executive meeting, so as to fully reflect the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the achievements of state-owned enterprises among the whole people.
The second step, "additional results", is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are facing pressure, and this transfer as the main body of state funds, most of them have the ability to continue to make profits and pay dividends, not only to effectively supplement the social security funds, but also to provide a source of live water for the social security funds.
Some calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the contribution and deposit ratio of basic old-age insurance for enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the rotation, "additional results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The transfer of the main body to receive the proceeds of the way is " dividend-based, operation as a supplementary. "
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, do receive dividends mainly from equity.
However, social security funds, as value investors of the capital market, have strong capability of capital operation.
As for listed assets of state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the governance structure of listed enterprises as legal persons, promote the level of enterprise operations, and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, social security funds as the investment vane, the rise of heavy stakes in the market is conducive to further enhance its influence and play a role in the market "stabilizer.
In addition, it is also beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guide investors to invest rationally and value investment.

Iran Confirmed to Develop Advanced Centrifuge Further Suspension of Iranian Nuclear Accord
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Sunday that Iran has violated the Iranian nuclear agreement again by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, China Central News Agency (CNA) reported.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the limits of the Iranian nuclear deal in response to U.S. President Trump's May 2018 withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, the resumption and strengthening of Iranian sanctions.
Iran has made further moves since suspending two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and to limit its purity to 3.67 per cent.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran can accumulate enriched uranium at Natanz with only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, and only a small number of more sophisticated aircraft are allowed to be used for research but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for a bomb.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that "on 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iranian advanced centrifuges developed for aircraft Types 2 and 3 ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium".
"They are busy at the [Natanz uranium enrichment] facility," said a diplomatic official at the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, which presented the report to Member States on the 26th.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge to the world.
The white paper says that as China's overall national strength and international influence grow rapidly, there are international concerns that China will follow the path of "one strong country, one hegemony" and some have raised the so-called "China threat theory".
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances caused by the decline of power, and deliberate distortions to protect their own vested interests.
To achieve national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of people of all countries.
China's development is an opportunity, not a threat or a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, and China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth.
At present, the world's economic growth is under-motivated, and China's sound economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is moving from high-speed growth to sound economic development.New industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization have been accelerated, the economic structure has been deeply adjusted, industrial optimization has been continuously upgraded, and new economic growth points have been emerging.
“The McKinsey Global Research Institute’s study suggests that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world’s economies could create between $22 trillion and $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15-26 per cent of the world’s total, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world and China could create enormous economic value.”
The white paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world's economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term boon to world economic development.
It is not feasible and harmful to view China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" and to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains and value chains so as to "decouple" China from the world economy.
The white paper points out that all-directional opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share the <unk>hina dividend<unk>?
China will unswervingly pursue a win-win strategy of opening up to the outside world, achieve greater intensity and a higher level of openness.China has the world's most potential consumer market, and is the most attractive investment destination.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and for the benefit of one party.
Mutual benefits can be long lasting.
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection,' the white paper said.
Only when all sides act in a mutually beneficial manner can we create an environment of development that is open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced and win-win, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger so as to form a mutually beneficial and win-win interest community.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
These include promoting high-quality building of the "China-Pacific Partnership", establishing a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited the international community, and it has always remembered to give back to the international family and provide more and better public goods to the international community.

Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.

Demonstrators Blast President as Rains Approach Egypt Authorities Show Strength in Repression
Twitter themes and social media are trumpeting Egyptians to take to the streets today in a peaceful plea for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Disapproval has all but disappeared in Egypt since then-military chief Morsi seized power in a 2013 coup, putting any kind of protest at extreme risk.
The Guardian newspaper reported that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since a rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Mr Sesi's ouster.
Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday to demonstrate against corruption allegations that he and his family squandered public money in pursuit of vanity.
Egypt's Interior Ministry yesterday stood firm and said it would resolutely resist any attempt to destabilize the country.
Riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes officers were all over the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's 2011 revolution, in central Cairo, already heavily guarded.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces on the 25th detained a number of important scholars and social sages, including Cairo University political science professor and prominent columnist Nafa.
On the 24th he tweeted: "I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Sessi will be disastrous."
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately. "
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who served as a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, General Annan, was detained.
Mr. Annan was arrested last year after trying to run against Mr. Sessi for the presidency.
Constitutional Party Chairman Davutoglu has also been detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that sweeping dissidents reflects instability and fragility at a time of heightened economic hardship for the poor and middle classes.
"The seizure highlights the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how much it fears for itself, " said Ayman Nour, an opposition leader who was once in contention for the presidency.
"Because the economy has been ruined by him, combined with widespread political repression, he has tried to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who might be replaced.
Mr. Knoll says the government's high-handed tactics will only increase anger if the socioeconomic situation continues to deteriorate.
Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor now living in exile in Spain, and a former Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos at the beginning of the month in which he pledged to benefit from government corruption, sparking a wave of small demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Mr. Ali says his firm, Amrak General Contracting, does not have to go through the legal tender process to get lucrative contracts, stressing the corruption practices of the military and members of Mr. Sisi's family, including Intissar Amer al-Sisi, the first lady.
He was deeply remorseful for his part in it.
Mr Ali claims he has not paid for the opulent palaces and luxury hotels that he helped build, in stark contrast to the abject poverty of Egyptian life.
Theme tags on Twitter such as "Stand up and you're not alone", "Sisi is done," "Sisi must go," and "next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling for people to take to the streets peacefully to demand his ouster.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amavec has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday he tweeted in Arabic: "Sisi is doomed. . . he is done. His supporters are making a big mistake now. "
Free Special Training Scheme Launched to Help Employees Affected by the Recent Economy
The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (March 27) announced the introduction of a special free training scheme for employees affected by the recent economic situation. Eligible trainees will be entitled to a training allowance of up to HK$4,000 per month upon completion of the programme.
Many boutiques in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui Harbour City have very few customers.
Recent social strife in Hong Kong has led to a sharp drop in the number of visitors to the territory. Apart from the tourism industry, the hotel, catering and retail sectors have also been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Law Chi-kong, and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Edward Yau, meet the media on the commissioning of the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) to implement a special training programme and measures to support the tourism industry.
Mr Law said the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy were imminent and that work should not wait for calm.
Therefore, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government launched this "special love value-added" free training program.
People who are unemployed or on unpaid leave as required by their employers from June 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the Scheme, provided they meet the relevant requirements, the spokesman said.
Mr Law said the courses covered a wide range of subjects, the most important of which was "professional skills" training covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering. There were also new "innovation and technology" courses and "universal skills" courses across industries.
Mr Yu Pengchun, Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, said all courses were free of charge and the scheme was expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participants of the Scheme are entitled to a special allowance of HK$4,000 per month for each full-time or part-time course completed and attended at a rate of 80%.
The spokesman said the two- to three-month training courses were offered by about 50 training institutions and could be attended by the public from October 3 to March 31 next year.
Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide over the difficulties.
These measures include relaxing the allocation to the Travel Industry Council (TIC), subsidising 6,000 tour guides to renew their licences and waiving the annual fees for travel agents.
Exercise tired also tired brain?
The brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise, according to a study of athletes, Russian Satellite.com reported.
The study, led by Dr. Mathias Pesglion, a specialist at France's Pithier-Salpetrier Hospital, suggests an inconspicuous link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activity.
"You need to control the autonomous processes that force you to stop when your muscles and joints are aching, " explained Perciglione.
The study was carried out by France's National Institute of Sport and Sports (INSEP).
The school's specialists are in charge of coaching athletes for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, in which uncontrollable tiredness after high-loaded exercise causes the body to fail to recover and performance to decline.
INSEP raises the question of whether part of the cause of the condition is nervous fatigue, the kind that results from over-brain work.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

White Paper: China Takes a Developing Road in line with National Conditions
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the State Council of China (SCO) today (Sept. 27) released a white paper on China and the world in a new era.
The white paper points out that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have painstakingly explored and stepped forward, successfully blazed a trail of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
The white paper says China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development depends on the do-it-yourself spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing", and generations of people have struggled ceaselessly and sustainedly, paying hardships and sweats that no one else can imagine.It relies on the spirit of "carrying your own burden" and developing itself through good times and bad, not exporting problems, passing on contradictions, and plundering other countries by forceful buying and selling.
The white paper says China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development by developing its ties and interactions with the rest of the world, and its road is in line with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
China safeguards world peace by practical actions.
In the past 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict on its own initiative, nor has it invaded or occupied any other country's land.
The white paper points out that the fundamental reason for China's great success in development over the past 70 years is that it has found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly followed it.
This is a road that is based on the national conditions, puts the interests of the people first, reforms and innovations, seeks common development through opening up and governs the country in an all-round way according to law.
Without unified and strong leadership, China will be divided and disintegrated, bringing disaster to the world.
'Over the past 70 years, China has defeated all kinds of risks and challenges and created one Chinese miracle after another that has captured the world's attention,' the white paper says.
Especially since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China has made historic achievements and undergone historic changes in its development.The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up and becoming rich to becoming strong, and is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation than at any other time in history.
This road of development of China will show more and more bright prospects as the times advance.

The new regulation solicits the opinion: The social capital obtains the rural land management right to need the qualification
Social Capital Needs Qualifications to Acquire Rural Land Management Right
Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right to Seek Public Opinions It is proposed to supervise the transfer of social capital, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to acquire the land management right
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the website of the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Right (Amendment Draft for Opinions) (hereinafter referred to as the Opinion Draft) for public consultation, increasing the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain the right to land management.
The draft ideas are now open for public comment.
To implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the system of "three-power separation", the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Measures for the Transfer of the Right to the Management of Rural Land Contracting, resulting in the draft Opinions, the Ministry said.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters have learned that the first publication of the draft "opinion" has made several important changes.
The newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting clarifies the scope of land circulation and implements the concept of the separation of three powers.The special section sets forth the "right to contract and manage land" and the "right to manage land" respectively, making a clear distinction between the transfer, interchange and transfer of the right to contract and manage land (by lease, subcontract, shareholding or other means).
In this draft Opinion, in order to implement the concept of "three-power separation" and effectively respond to the gist of the revision of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and to take into account the differences between the parties, procedures and supervision in the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land management rights, the revised draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, such as leasing and share-taking, and revises the name of the Regulation from the Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting Rights to the Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights.
For the transfer of land contract management rights, swap will be issued separate management measures for the provisions.
The draft notes that under the "three-power separation" background, farmers only have the right to operate the land for a certain period of time.
Theoretically speaking, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, there is only a risk that the peasants will lose the right to operate for a certain period of time.
In order to prevent farmers from losing their land, the practice of preferential shares, lease-first, buy-back and other methods have come into being.
Considering that preferred shares have been maturely discussed in the company law, it is suggested to take it as an advocacy provision to guard against the risk of losing land.
