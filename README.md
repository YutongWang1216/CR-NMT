The ability of commonsense reasoning (CR)
decides whether a neural machine translation
(NMT) model can move beyond pattern recognition. Despite the rapid advancement of NMT
and the use of pretraining to enhance NMT
models, research on CR in NMT is still in its infancy, leaving much to be explored in terms of
effectively training NMT models with high CR
abilities and devising accurate automatic evaluation metrics. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at expanding the understanding of CR in NMT. For the training, we confirm
the effectiveness of incorporating pretrained
knowledge into NMT models and subsequently
utilizing these models as robust testbeds for
investigating CR in NMT. For the evaluation,
we propose a novel entity-aware evaluation
method that takes into account both the NMT
candidate and important entities in the candidate, which is more aligned with human judgement. Based on the strong testbed and evaluation methods, we identify challenges in training NMT models with high CR abilities and
suggest directions for further unlabeled data
utilization and model design. We hope that our
methods and findings will contribute to advancing the research of CR in NMT.


## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YutongWang1216/CR-NMT.git
cd CR-NMT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Examples

### Entity-Aware BERTScore
To calculate entity-aware BERTScore between candidates and right/contrastive references, run the following script 
(taking the candidates of Pt-Nmt as an example, model files will be downloaded automatically during initial running):
```bash
python ent_bertscore/ent_score.py \
    --candidate data/ptnmt/cr-test.hyp \
    --r_reference data/cr_testset/test.true.en \
    --c_reference data/cr_testset/test.wrong.en \
    --weight 1.4 \
    --outdir example/
```
More information about these parameters can be acquired by running `python ent_bertscore/ent_score.py --help`.

After running, two score files `true.score.bert_1.4` and `wrong.score.bert_1.4` will be found 
at the output directory `example/`, consisting of right side and contrastive side scores, respectively.


### Commonsense Reasoning Accuracy
Given the right and contrastive side scores, to calculate commonsense reasoning accuracy, run the following script
(results of the previous step are used here):
```bash
python CR_accuracy/calculate_accuracy.py \
    --r_score example/true.score.bert_1.4 \
    --c_score example/wrong.score.bert_1.4
```
More information about these parameters can be acquired by running `python CR_accuracy/calculate_accuracy.py --help`.


### Meta-Evaluation of Commonsense Reasoning Metrics
To conduct a meta-evaluation on the commonsense reasoning metrics, run the following scripts to examine the correlation 
between metric scores and human annotations (results of the first step are used here, but the scripts work 
not only for BERTScore, but also for other instance-level scores, such as Prob, BLEU and BLEURT):
```bash
# chi-square test
python meta-evaluation/evaluate.py \
    --r_score example/true.score.bert_1.4 \
    --c_score example/wrong.score.bert_1.4 \
    --human data/ptnmt/human.label \
    --method chi
    
# Kendall rank correlation coefficient
python meta-evaluation/evaluate.py \
    --r_score example/true.score.bert_1.4 \
    --c_score example/wrong.score.bert_1.4 \
    --human data/ptnmt/human.label \
    --method kendall
    
# Analysis of variance
python meta-evaluation/evaluate.py \
    --r_score example/true.score.bert_1.4 \
    --c_score example/wrong.score.bert_1.4 \
    --human data/ptnmt/human.label \
    --method anova
```
More information about these parameters can be acquired by running `python meta-evaluation/evaluate.py --help`.
